# Performance Baseline Report

## Build Output (Before Optimization)

**Build completed at:** $(date)

### Current Bundle Sizes:
- Main JS bundle: ~1.2MB (estimated from current build)
- CSS bundle: ~100KB (estimated)
- Total assets: Multiple files in dist/assets/

### Key Dependencies Analysis:
- React Router DOM: Client-side routing
- ShadCN/UI: Large component library with Radix primitives
- React Simple Maps: Geographic visualization
- Recharts: Chart library
- D3-scale: Data visualization utilities
- Multiple Radix UI components

### Initial Observations:
- Single large JS bundle (no code splitting)
- All routes loaded upfront
- Heavy component libraries loaded immediately
- No vendor chunking strategy
- All UI components bundled together

**Next Steps:** Add bundle visualizer and implement optimizations
