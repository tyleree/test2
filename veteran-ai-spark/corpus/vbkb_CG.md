These typically are usually detected during routine lab testing (blood work) or as things noticed during other diagnostic tests such as an X-Ray or MRI.

But these conditions themselves have either not become severe enough to manifest into more severe conditions.

Common lab finding are fatty liver or pre-diabetes. Both while diagnosed conditions, are themselves not disabilities and as such **CANNOT** be given service-connection.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- Even though a lab finding itself cannot get service connection. Service connection **CAN** be granted for conditions the lab finding causes _so long as_ the lab finding is favorably linked to service.

However, it is best practice to simply claim the disability directly.

<!-- Chunk 29/1206 | Heading: Lab Findings | Words: 132 -->

### For Example:

You have low testosterone which has been linked as the cause of your erectile dysfunction. You would claim the erectile dysfunction and state it is caused by your low testosterone via (link to service). So possibly as due to [TERA](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/toxic)  exposures for instance.

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- Veterans who are service-connected for any dental or oral conditions are entitled to [Dental health care](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/dental)  through the VA.

- For the purposes of Range of Motion (ROM), the examiner/rater are **REQUIRED** to consider flair ups in your conditions. Meaning, if you do not happen to have an [Examination](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/cnp)  on your worst day, the examiner is required to reasonably estimate your impairment on your worst day! The rater is required to use this estimate, unless your ROM is somehow noted as being worse during ROM testing during the exam. In any event, the rater is to use the most impaired ROM measurements noted by the examiner!

NOTES:

- To warrant elevation based on mechanically altered foods, the use of texture-modified diets **MUST** be recorded or verified by a _physician_.

- Mechanically altered foods are defined as altered by blending, chopping, grinding or mashing so that they are easy to chew and swallow. There are four levels of mechanically altered foods:

1. Semisolid foods;

2. Soft;

3. Puree; and

4. Full liquid.

- Loss of teeth can **ONLY** be granted for Service-connection for disability compensation **IF** the lost teeth **CANNOT** be replaced!

- Do **NOT** submit a claim for lost teeth that **CAN** be replaced! The proper action is to talk to your VAMC dental clinic and ask them about getting care (stating you meet one of the following criteria). They will then initiate a 'claim' to establish service-connection for dental care. For more information click [HERE](https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018/content/554400000173836/M21-1-Part-XIII-Subpart-i-Chapter-4-Section-B-Processing-Dental-Claims)

### Cavities

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- Do **NOT** submit a [Disability claim](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vaclaim)  for cavities! The proper action is to talk to your VAMC dental clinic and ask them about getting care (stating you meet one of the following criteria). They will then initiate a 'claim' to establish service-connection for dental care. For more information click [HERE](https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018/content/554400000173836/M21-1-Part-XIII-Subpart-i-Chapter-4-Section-B-Processing-Dental-Claims)

- While the law states you can get service-connection... it isn't actually handled by the VBA. As cavities can **NEVER** be a service-conditioned for disability compensation.
- Teeth with cavities _can_ **_ONLY_** be service-connected **FOR** [**DENTAL CARE**](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/dental)  if one the following conditions are meet:

- Teeth were **NORMAL** when entering service and were filled **after 180 days** of _active_ service; _or_

- Teeth _had_ fillings when entering service and the filling was _replaced_ **after 180 days** of _active_ service.
- Teeth that _needed_ fillings when entering service and were later filled **CANNOT** be service-connected!

- **UNLESS**, the filling is later replaced **after 180 days** of _active_ service - then it **CAN** then be service-connected.
- The cavity **MUST** be exist (unfilled) in order to get service-connection (care)!

| Rating | Description |

### Teeth Grinding (Bruxism)

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- Do **NOT** submit a claim for bruxism! The proper action is to talk to your VAMC dental clinic and ask them about getting care. They will then initiate a 'claim' to establish service connection for dental care. For more information click [HERE](https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018/content/554400000173836/M21-1-Part-XIII-Subpart-i-Chapter-4-Section-B-Processing-Dental-Claims)

- Instead of filing a claim for bruxism, you may be better served filing a claim for [TMJ](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/mouthsystem#9905)  So you might file TMJ secondary to [PTSD](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/mental#9411)  for example.

From the mouth to the anus, itâ€™s a journey quite famous.

**PRESUMPTIVE CONDITION:**

- Functional gastrointestinal disorders to include abdominal pain, bloating, constipation, indigestion, difficulty swallowing, or vomiting it exposed to [Gulf environmental hazards](https://sunflower-brass-pcgs.squarespace.com/gulfill)  and the condition is considered a MUCMI.

- MUCMIs associated with undiagnosed gastrointestinal issues are evaluated under the [IBS](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/digsystem#7319)  schedule _or_ [Gastrointestinal dysmotility syndrome](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/digsystem#7356)  whichever provides the higher evaluation.

- Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is **NOT** considered to be a functional disorder!

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- The VA can and does employ fair bit of squinting when evaluating digestive conditions. Meaning, even if the rating schedule states **AND**, and you do **NOT** have **_ALL_** the symptoms, the rater can still award that evaluation ( [38 CFR 4.7](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/38/4.7)

* * *

<!-- Chunk 61/1206 | Heading: Rating Schedule for the Digestive System | Words: 191 -->

---

## **GENERAL PYRAMIDING NOTES:**

- Veterans **CANNOT** get separate evaluations for 2 or more conditions evaluated under any the following diagnostic codes at the same time: 7301-7329, 7331, 7342, 7345-7350, 7352, 7355-7357.

- In the event that you have multiple conditions that fall within the above pyramiding note and the conditions result in a greater degree of disability than the schedules of any one of conditions would rate; The rater can increase the evaluation to the next higher degree of severity under the schedule of one of those conditions. This way your conditions are more accurately considered and better reflect your total degree of disability. e.g. if the schedule for a condition would put you at 30% with the next highest rating being 60%. But your other pyramiding digestive conditions are so severe that the approximate disability is that of 60%. The rater can awarded a singular rating of 60% instead of the 30% you would have otherwise gotten.
- These listed conditions are **NOT** all the conditions which are prohibited from being rated together!

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- If you were evaluated under the old general pyramiding notes (before May 19, 2024) and you have conditions which are now allowed to be rated separately, the VA **WILL** award separate evaluations if doing so would be a good thing for the Veteran!

* * *

<!-- Chunk 62/1206 | Heading: GENERAL PYRAMIDING NOTES: | Words: 224 -->

---

### Examples

- You were rated for GERD with IBS at 30% with **BOTH** conditions having a severity worth a rating of 30% each (if they could have been rated separated under the old schedule). If you filed a claim for increase for IBS the VA would look at the IBS based upon the _current schedule_; if the IBS rated 0% on the _current schedule,_ VA would leave things as they were - so long as you would still rate at least 30% under the old schedule (or had other [Protections](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/ratingsindex#protection)

- If the IBS instead rated 10% on the current _schedule_; the VA would keep the GERD at 30% and award a separate evaluation for the IBS at 10%!

<!-- Chunk 63/1206 | Heading: Examples | Words: 120 -->

---

### Weight

- Baseline weight:

- The clinically documented average weight for the **TWO-YEAR** period **BEFORE** the onset of illness or, if relevant, the weight recorded at the Veteran's most recent discharge physical. If neither of these weights are available or currently relevant, then use **IDEAL** body weight as determined by either the [Hamwi formula](https://www.bmi-calculator.net/ideal-weight-calculator/hamwi-formula/)  _or_ [Body Mass Index tables](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/adult_bmi/english_bmi_calculator/bmi_calculator.html)  whichever is most favorable to the Veteran.
- Minor weight loss:

- Involuntary weight loss _between 10 and 20%_ of an individual's baseline weight _sustained for 3 months_ with gastrointestinal-related symptoms, involving diminished quality of self-care or work tasks, or decreased food intake.
- Substantial weight loss:

- Involuntary loss greater than 20% of an individual's baseline weight _sustained for three months_ with diminished quality of self-care or work tasks.
- Inability to gain weight:

- Substantial weight loss with the inability to regain it despite following appropriate therapy.

* * *

### Nutrition

- Undernutrition:

- Deficiency resulting from insufficient intake of one or multiple essential nutrients, or the inability of the body to absorb, utilize, or retain such nutrients. Undernutrition is characterized by failure of the body to maintain normal organ functions and healthy tissues. Signs and symptoms may include: loss of subcutaneous tissue, edema, peripheral neuropathy, muscle wasting, weakness, abdominal distention, ascites, and Body Mass Index below normal range.
- Nutritional Support: The following describe various nutritional support methods used to treat certain digestive conditions:

- Total parenteral nutrition or hyperalimentation:

- Special liquid mixture given into the blood through an intravenous catheter. The mixture contains proteins, carbohydrates (sugars), fats, vitamins, and minerals. Total parenteral nutrition bypasses the normal digestion in the stomach and bowel.

- Assisted enteral nutrition:

- Special liquid mixture (containing proteins, carbohydrates (sugar), fats, vitamins and minerals) to be delivered into the stomach or bowel through a flexible feeding tube.

- Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy:

- Type of assisted enteral nutrition in which a flexible feeding tube is inserted through the abdominal wall and into the stomach.

- Nasogastric or nasoenteral feeding tube:

- Type of assisted parental nutrition in which a flexible feeding tube is inserted through the nose into the stomach or bowel.

**PYRAMIDING NOTE:**

- You **CANNOT** get multiple separate evaluations for hernias under _this_ schedule.

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- Due to there being 2 inguinal canals, it is possible for them _both_ to herniate. In the event both are herniated and they **BOTH** would get a rating of _at least 10%_ then the rating gets the following special treatment:

- When the pancreas does not produce enough insulin (Type 1); or

- When the body does not respond properly to insulin (Type 2).

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- It is the Department of Veteranâ€™s Affairs (VAâ€™s) policy to concede that an individualâ€™s diabetes mellitus requires insulin, restricted diet, _and_ regulation of activities when the diabetes has caused episodes of ketoacidosis that have resulted in hospitalization.

- Gestational diabetes (Type 3) diabetes that can occur during pregnancy **CANNOT** be given a rating as the condition is _temporary_.

- Prescription of a non-insulin injectable medication (like Ozempic, Victoza, Trulicity, or other generic versions) is considered to be an oral hypoglycemic agent for rating purposes.Â They are **_NOT_** considered as equivalent to treatment with insulin!

**PRESUMPTIVE CONDITION:**

- If diagnosed within a [Year](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/time)  of separation **AND** the severity warranted _at least_ a 10% evaluation within that time; _or_

- If exposed to [Agent Orange](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/agentorange)  **AND** the severity _ever_ warranted _at least_ a 10% evaluation.

Definition:

- Regulation of activities -

- Voluntary avoidance of strenuous activity with the intention of avoiding hypoglycemic episodes, does **NOT** meet the regulatory criteria.

- Prescribed or voluntary exercise also does **NOT** satisfy the regulation-of-activities criterion.

- Evidence **MUST** document that the avoidance of strenuous activities is _required/prescribed_ as part of medical management of the individualâ€™s diabetes.

| Rating | Description |

### 1\. Urinary Frequency

Condition causes you to urinate more often than normal.

| Rating | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 10% | Must urinate every 2-3 hours, during the day; _or_ must urinate 2 times, during the night. |

### 2\. Obstructed Urination (Voiding)

Condition makes it hard to urinate.

| Rating | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 0% | There are only symptoms (hesitancy to start urinating, slow or weak stream, or low force of stream). With or without needing stretching treatments 1-2 times a year. |
| 10% | There are obvious symptoms (hesitancy to start urinating, slow or weak stream, or low force of stream) with 1 or more of the following: 1) Greater than 150cc of urine remains in bladder after you finish urinating; 2) Less than a 10cc/sec peak flow rate; 3) Regular urinary tract infections due to the obstruction; 4) Requires stretching treatments at least once every 2-3 months. |
| 30% | Requires the intermittent _or_ continuous use of a catheter. |

* * *

<!-- Chunk 205/1206 | Heading: 2\. Obstructed Urination (Voiding) | Words: 136 -->

---

### 3\. Voiding Dysfunction

When the urinary condition just does not quite fit under frequency or obstructed urination measures.

This usually boils down to conditions that cause loss of bladder control resulting in _continual urine leakage_ (urinary incontinence).

| Rating | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 20% | Requires the wearing of absorbent materials (such as pads or diapers) which must be changed once a day. |
| 40% | Requires the wearing of absorbent materials which must be changed 2-4 times a day. |
| 60% | Requires the use of an appliance (such as a catheter); _or_ the wearing of absorbent materials which must be changed more than 4 times a day. |

**RATER NOTE:**

- When a catheter is used _primarily_ as a tool to _retain urine_ then the Veteran should be rated under the [Obstructed urination schedule](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/gensystem#obstructed)  and **NOT** this one. Unless, this schedule better captures the predominant disability.

- New onset of debilitating fatigue severe enough to reduce daily activity to less than 50% of the usual level for at least 6 months; **AND**

- The exclusion, by history, physical examination, and laboratory tests, of **_ALL_** other clinical conditions that may produce similar symptoms; **AND**

- There **MUST** be _at least_ **6** of the following symptoms present:

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- It is critical that you be 100% brutally honest with your [C&P](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/cnp)  examiner! Do **NOT** leave anything on the table. This isn't the time to keep things in or try to save face.

- That said, do **NOT** exaggerate or fabricate things! Your examiner isn't [Stupid](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/exinsight)

**PYRAMIDING NOTES:**

- Veterans can only have **ONE Mental Health Rating**. If the Veteran has multiple mental disorders. The symptoms will be combined and a single rating will be given!

- The only exception to this is if the Veteran has an _eating disorder_. In which case the Veteran will have a single rating for their mental health disorder(s) and another singular rating for the eating disorder.

## **Intellectual and Personality Disorders**

Intellectual and Personality Disorders are generally considered to be something a person is born with, not something that develops. (Having a large genetic or hereditary component, with negligible environmental factors.)

Because of this, the VA does **NOT** consider these disorders as diseases or injuries for compensation purposes.

**UNLESS**, they are the result of another service-connected disability such as a [Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/tbi)  **OR** your service made your disorder measurably worse than when you joined service ( [Aggravated](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/agg)

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- If service-connected, the VA will **NOT** issue secondary service-connection from any disabilities that are a result of these disorders, the exception being if the Veteran has another mental disorder that is service-connected and the VA can associate those disabilities to it.

Intellectual and personality disorders include but are not limited to:

- Antisocial personality disorder

- Attention deficit disorder

- Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)

- Autism spectrum disorder

- Avoidant personality disorder

- Borderline personality disorder

- Child-onset fluency disorder (stuttering)

- Intellectual developmental disorder

- Intellectual disability

- Learning disabilities

- Mental retardation

- Narcissistic personality disorder

- Schizoid personality disorder

- Specified learning disorder

- Tic disorder

## **Remaining Mental Disorders**

The following types and named disorders are explicitly recognized by the VA as being rateable. If your mental disorder is _not_ listed, it will likely be rated [Analogously](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/diagnosticcodes#analog)  This includes sleeping disorders such as insomnia.

Speaking of insomnia...

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- Insomnia is generally considered a symptom of another disability due to coexisting physical or mental conditions.

- For example: major depressive disorder, pain, or another sleep disorder like [Sleep apnea](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/airsystem#6847)

Service-connection **CAN** be established for insomnia in the absence of a known or established underlying cause **IF** there is:

- An event in service (such as a diagnosis of primary insomnia in service);

- A current diagnosis of primary insomnia; and

- A [Nexus](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/imo)  establishing primary insomnia is connected to the event in service, and the condition is **NOT** associated with any other disease or injury.

**_EXCEPTION to the RULES_**

- Only the [Board of Veterans Appeals (BVA)](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals#bva)  and higher courts have the ability to grant secondary service-connection for insomnia!

## **Mental Disorder Ratings**

General mental health disorders are rated based upon the severity of the totality of a Veteran's symptoms. As such, the Veteran's formal diagnosis is actually not important for the purposes of how you are rated. As the Veteran will get a single rating no matter the number of formal diagnoses they may have.

Know that a Veteran who is diagnosed with depression or anxiety for example. Can be rated just as highly as someone with PTSD. Further, the more diagnoses a Veteran has, does **NOT** mean they are more likely to get a higher rating. Again, the Veteran's rating will be based upon the _severity_ of their symptoms!

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- When [Filing](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/)  for PTSD the following form is generally **REQUIRED**:

- Supporting Statements for Service-connection for PTSD [VA Form 21-0781](http://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-21-0781-ARE.pdf)

### How a Rater Decides

The mental health rating schedule is unique in that it relies upon the a wide array of symptoms and evidence in order to determine the Veteran's rating.

Ultimately, a Veteran's rating is based upon the rating percentage that most closely resembles the totality of their symptoms, which is determined based upon all the evidence submitted.

This includes:

- [C&P Examiner's Report](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/)

- [DBQ](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/)

- [Nexus Letters](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/)

- [Buddy Letters](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/)  [VA Form 21-10210](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-21-10210-ARE.pdf)

- [Personal Statements](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/)  [VA Form 21-4138](https://www.va.gov/vaforms/form_detail.asp?FormNo=21-4138)

- Supporting Statements for Service Connection for PTSD [VA Form 21-0781](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-21-0781-ARE.pdf)

- Private/VA Treatment Notes

- [Vet Center](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/)  Notes (you **MUST** give the VBA [Written permission](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/vba-21-4142-are.pdf)  to access these notes!)

Do know that just because you may have a few symptoms in areas that are attributed to higher rating percentages, it does **NOT** mean you will be awarded that higher percentage. Your rating will be based upon the _totality_ of your symptoms and evidence before the rater.

And know... you do **NOT** need to meet every example in a given percentage to be awarded that percentage! They just serve as examples, **NOT** requirements.

Generally speaking, there are four areas involved when considering severity:

- Ability to Care for Yourself

- Ability to Work

- Social Relationships

- Symptoms

## **Common** [**Secondary Conditions**](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/claimtype\#secondary)

If your mental disorder and/or the medications used to treat it cause secondary disabilities. Those additional disabilities may be service-connected. Further, if those secondary disabilities spawn further disabilities those may also be service-connected.

Veterans should at a minimum have a proper diagnosis before filing a claim. Depending upon the medical evidence available, Veteran's age, weight, other conditions, etc. A Veteran may need an [IMO](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/imo)  to have a decent chance of getting service-connection. This is particularly the case for sleep apnea.

- [Erectile Dysfunction (ED)](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/gensystem#7522)  / [Female Sexual Arousal Disorder (FSAD)](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/femalesystem#7632)

- Maximum rating is 0% rating. However, it will entitle the Veteran to [SMC K](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/smc#k)  which will add around $110 a month to their monthly disability compensation.

- [Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/digsystem#7319)

- [Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/digsystem#7206)

- [Sleep Apnea (SA)](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/airsystem#6847)

- [Temporomandibular Disorder (TMD, Temporomandibular Joint Dysfunction, TMJ Syndrome, TMJ)](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/mouthsystem#9905)

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- If you think medication is the cause of the condition, **SAY** that in your claim! Otherwise the examiner may play stupid with their opinion.

NOTE:

- Veterans who self medicated with illegal substances and/or alcohol **MAY** be able to get service-connected for conditions that developed from those abuses.

## **PTSD Service-Connection**

While PTSD is **NOT** rated differently from other mental health disorders. It _does_ have different criteria regarding getting service-connection, and has a separate examination (DBQ) from all other mental health conditions.

Specifically, PTSD requires an _in-service stressor_.

Do know that Veterans may develop PTSD _outside_ of direct combat exposure. This includes but is not limited to:

- Aircraft crashes;

- Assault;

- Battery;

- Environmental disasters (earthquakes, fires, floods, etc);

- Fear of hostile enemy forces;

- Harassment;

- Military Sexual Trauma (MST);

- Sexual assault;

- Sexual harassment;

- Rape;
- Mugging;

- Robbery;

- Serving as a Drone Aircraft Crew Member;

- Serving in Mortuary Affairs;

- Stalking;

- Training accidents; or

- Vehicular crashes.

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- Fear of hostile enemy forces does **NOT** include:

- Anticipation of future deployment to a location of hostile military or terrorist activity; or

- Learning of the death of another person, when such death occurred away from the Veteran in a location of hostile military or terrorist activity.

**RATER NOTE:**

- If the Veteran is **NOT** diagnosed with PTSD, but instead some stressor based mental disorder. The stressor **CANNOT** be conceded based on fear! The stressor **MUST** be verified!

NOTES:

- This list is not all inclusive.

- If possible, it is a best practice for the Veteran to try to obtain and submit evidence themselves, instead of depending on the VA to get it for you.

### Markers for Personal Trauma

In the event that the service member did not report their personal trauma, the VA will look for markers to help determine service-connection.

Evidence that may be a marker of trauma includes but is not limited to:

- Alcohol or drug abuse;

- Changes in performance and performance evaluations;

- Episodes of depression, panic attacks, or anxiety without identifiable reasons;

- Increased disregard for military or civilian authority;

- Increased use or abuse of leave without an apparent reason, such as family obligations or family illness;

- Increased or decreased use of prescription medications;

- Increased use of over-the-counter medications;

- Obsessive behavior such as overeating or undereating;

- Sudden requests that the Veteranâ€™s military occupational series or duty assignment be changed without other justification;

- Treatment for physical injuries around the time of the claimed trauma, but not reported as a result of the trauma, and/or the breakup of a primary relationship;

- Unexplained economic or social behavior changes;

## **Ratersâ€™ Discretion (Rating Wiggle)**

Raters have a fair bit of wiggle when it comes to evaluating mental health. Meaning, a rater **CAN** use their discretion to tip the scale toward a higher _or_ lower percentage based upon their opinion on the totality of evidence.

Because of this wiggle, if you feel you should rate higher you _should_ consider filing a [Higher Level Review (HLR)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals)

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- This wiggle does **NOT** apply to the granting of service-connection itself!

## **Hospitalizations (Temporary 100%)**

Veterans who are [Hospitalized](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/ratingsindex#29)  at a VA hospital or at an approved hospital for 22 or more continuous days due to a service-connected rating will be paid at the **100% rate**, going back to the day that they were admitted in the hospital.

This 100% rating will be paid to the end of the month that the Veteran was discharged in\*.

\*Unless the hospitalization lasted at least six months due to mental health. In such case, the Veteran will continue to receive the 100% rating for 6 months. At which point the Veteran will receive a [Reevaluation](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/cnp)  to determine their current level of disability.

## **Frequently** **Asked Questions**

- #### Can my rating be reduced if taking medication or doing other treatments improve my symptoms?

- **Maybe IF YOU PUT IN a claim for increase**. Yeah, that's the best answer I have gotten from speaking with several senior raters. It will come down to the rater and their judgement. Such as, if they were reduced might it cause the Veteran to return to their original degree of disability etc.

- Generally, if they do decide you should be reduced, it will be by a degree of disability IE 70 to 50%. Instead of 70 to 30%.

- It is recommended if you do ever receive a proposal for reduction that you **quickly** request a [Hearing](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/reduction)

- #### Will my VA doctor snitch on me if I start improving?

- **NO**! There are very specific circumstances in which the VHA and VBA communicate! And improving is **NOT** one of them.

- Click [HERE](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/xtalk)  for details.

- #### Do I have to seek treatment to maintain my rating?

- No.

- #### I experienced a sexual assault/rape while I was AD but I never reported it. Can I still file a claim for PTSD?

- Yes, if you experienced MST during service. You may still file a claim if you never reported it. It is not at all uncommon for service members to suffer in silence. These claims will rely heavily on any evidence you can supply, such as any mental health treatment/therapy sessions, buddy statements from friends and family, etc. Do know, that even if your claim is denied, it does **NOT** mean the rater does not believe you! You might be missing a piece of the claims puzzle. As such, be sure to read your decision letter fully. It will explain what you need to do to win your claim during an [Appeal](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/)

- #### I filed a claim for sleep disturbances/insomnia but my claim lumped with my other mental condition. Why?

- If you have a mental health rating (outside of a eating disorder) then sleep disturbances/insomnia are considered a symptom of your mental health, even if they are caused by a physical issue such as pain. As such, it would be considered pyramiding and is not allowed.

- #### Can I be rated 100% if I currently have a job?

- Maybe... it will be very fact specific. Factors such as; are you full/part time, length of employment, type of employment, and is it in a [Sheltered environment](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/tdiu#sheltered)  etc.

- #### Can I work if I have a 100% for mental health?

- There is no restrictions with working with a 100% mental rating.

- #### If I tell the C&P examiner I am suicidal will I be committed against my will?

- The only time you will be committed against your will is if the examiner has reason to believe you are undergoing a mental health emergency and that you are likely to end your life in the near future. This usually is due to the examiner knowing you have a suicide plan and that you have indicated you have plans to carry them out.

- #### What do I do if the VA has found I cannot handle my money?

- The VA will assign you a fiduciary to handle your money. For more information click [HERE](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/)

- #### Does having a rating for mental health make me ineligible for a security clearance?

- No.

- #### My mental diagnosis changed is that an issue?

- It is not an issue. It is **SUPER** common for those in the mental health profession to have disagreements on what exactly someoneâ€™s mental health diagnosis is. You cannot really blame them since mental health is **VERY** complicated. If you were service-connected for PTSD and you are now diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) then thatâ€™s perfectly fine.

- #### My memory is bad... can I bring notes to my exam?

- Yes!

- A word of caution: if you start just reading things off to match with DBQ/rating schedule the examiner might find you to be less believable. Instead, your notes should focus more-so on examples of your issues.

## **Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQs)**

To get an idea of how a [C&P exam](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/cnp)  will be conducted it is recommended that the Veteran look at the applicable DBQ.

Veteran's may ask a licensed _psychiatrist_ or _psychologist_ to complete a DBQ on their behalf to submit with their claim. For more information on DBQs click [HERE](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/dbq)

This schedule can get a little complicated. So please carefully examine the tables.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- For the purposes of Range of Motion (ROM), the examiner/rater are **REQUIRED** to consider flair ups in your conditions. Meaning, if you do not happen to have an [Examination](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/cnp)  on your worst day, the examiner is required to reasonably estimate your impairment on your worst day! The rater is required to use this estimate, unless your ROM is somehow noted as being worse during ROM testing during the exam. In any event, the rater is to use the most impaired ROM measurements noted by the examiner!

**AMPUTATION RULE**

- Veteran **CANNOT** be rated higher for disabilities of a hand that would [Combine](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vamath)  to be more than a Veteran who has had an amputation of their hand.

- Which would be 70% for the dominant hand and 60% for the non-dominant hand.

NOTE:

- If the Veteran is ambidextrous. Then whichever hand is affected will be considered dominant.

* * *

<!-- Chunk 382/1206 | Heading: Rating Schedule for the Hand | Words: 233 -->

## **Amputation of Fingers**

Please refer to the above image to get an understanding of the degrees of severity of partial amputations (A-D).

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- In the event the Veteran has amputations involving differing degrees of severity the **AVERAGE** will be used.

- In the event the average ends in a tie, the Veteran will get the higher of the two.

**PYRAMIDING NOTE:**

- When two or more fingers of the same hand are affected by any combination of amputation, ankylosis, or limitation of motion that is not otherwise specified in the rating schedule, the evaluation level assigned will be that which best represents the overall disability (i.e., amputation, unfavorable or favorable ankylosis, or limitation of motion), assigning the higher level of evaluation when the level of disability is equally balanced between one level and the next higher level.

## **5224/5227 Joint Stiffness of Fingers (Ankylosis)**

When the finger joints cannot be moved _for the most part_ (ankylosis). Loss of use also applies to partial amputation of fingers. In Veterans who have losses involving more than one finger (on a single hand).

There are two grades of loss of use **Favorable** and **Unfavorable**.

- Favorable

- Amputations: Up to, but not including the palm.

- Lose of use: The second _and_ third knuckles are stuck at 30Â°; **OR** the second _or_ third knuckles are stuck but result with finger being within 2 inches or less of the palm when attempting to ball your fist; **OR** the thumb is within 2 inches or less from the palm.
- Unfavorable

- Amputations: Into the palm meat.

- Lose of use: Anything not within the range of favorable.

**PYRAMIDING NOTE:**

- When two or more fingers of the same hand are affected by any combination of amputation, ankylosis, or limitation of motion that is not otherwise specified in the rating schedule, the evaluation level assigned will be that which best represents the overall disability (i.e., amputation, unfavorable or favorable ankylosis, or limitation of motion), assigning the higher level of evaluation when the level of disability is equally balanced between one level and the next higher level.

### Loss of Most Use of One Finger

NOTE:

- Under this schedule, there is additional consideration given to fingers that have more than one joints frozen. Moving from fingertip to palm would have the joints counted as 1-3.

**KEY**

- ? = wildcard, any other joints combinations not listed

- '=' =, same rating if the finger is favorable or unfavorable

- Dom = Dominant Rating

- Non-Dom = Non-Dominant Rating

- Fav = Favorable

- UnF = Unfavorable

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- For the purposes of Range of Motion (ROM), the examiner/rater are **REQUIRED** to consider flair ups in your conditions. Meaning, if you do not happen to have an [Examination](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/cnp)  on your worst day, the examiner is required to reasonably estimate your impairment on your worst day! The rater is required to use this estimate, unless your ROM is somehow noted as being worse during ROM testing during the exam. In any event, the rater is to use the most impaired ROM measurements noted by the examiner!

## **Amputation Rule**

Veterans **CANNOT** have a total [Combined](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vamath)  rating for places in the body higher than a Veteran who had those areas amputated. IE A veteran who has various disabilities in their knee, ankle, and foot; Those ratings cannot combine to be more than a Veteran who had their leg amputated just above the knee.

## **5054 Hip Replacement (Prosthesis) or Resurfacing**

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- If the hip joint had **ANY** other musculoskeletal hip evaluations (ankylosis, range of motion, etc.) they **WILL BE** discontinued the date of the procedure!

- If **AFTER**, your temp 100% ends you think your evaluation should be higher you **CAN** file an [Increase claim](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vaclaim)

- As hip resurfacing/not total replacement, does not have a minimum evaluation an examination after the temp 100% ends is **REQUIRED**!

- Since the total hip replacement has a minimum evaluation a reexamination is **NOT** required.
- Medical evidence **MUST** show:

- Date of admission;

- Date of discharge;

- Date of surgery; **AND**

- Procedure performed.

- If the procedure is noted for a non-service-connected condition then the VA will get a medical opinion to determine if the non-service-connected condition is a progression of the service-connected condition.

**RATER NOTES:**

- Do **NOT** keep an open ended 100%! If you do not have an examination conducted **AFTER** the 100% ends for a resurfacing - you will return the hip to the evaluation(s) it had before the procedure and order an [At once examination](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mandatory)  and **END** the temp 100%!

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- For the purposes of Range of Motion (ROM), the examiner/rater are **REQUIRED** to consider flair ups in your conditions. Meaning, if you do not happen to have an [Examination](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/cnp)  on your worst day, the examiner is required to reasonably estimate your impairment on your worst day! The rater is required to use this estimate, unless your ROM is somehow noted as being worse during ROM testing during the exam. In any event, the rater is to use the most impaired ROM measurements noted by the examiner!

NOTE:

- For Veterans who are ambidextrous the affected limb **WILL** be considered dominant.

Amputation Rule

- Veterans **CANNOT** have a total [Combined](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vamath)  rating for places in the body higher than a Veteran who had those areas amputated. IE A veteran who has various disabilities in their knee, ankle, and foot; Those ratings cannot combine to be more than a Veteran who had their leg amputated just above the knee.

## **5051 Shoulder Replacement (Prosthesis)**

**PYRAMIDING NOTE:**

- If the joint had **ANY** other musculoskeletal evaluations (ankylosis, range of motion, etc.) they **WILL BE** discontinued the date of the procedure!

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- After the temporary 100% ends the Veteran can file for an increase if they feel their symptoms warrant a higher evaluation.

- If this condition could be rated higher under ankylosis, the rater will do so; replacing this evaluation.
- Medical evidence **MUST** show:

- Date of admission;

- Date of discharge;

- Date of surgery; **AND**

- Procedure performed.

- If the procedure is noted for a non-service-connected condition then the VA will get a medical opinion to determine if the non-service-connected condition is a progression of the service-connected condition.

**RATER NOTES:**

- Temp 100% includes a bonus 1 month due to 38 CFR 4.30, so while it says 1 year it is actually 13 months total!

- Example: Admitted for surgery June 12, 2025 and release June 12, 2025.

- Effective date of 100% due to 38 CFR 4.30 is June 12, 2025 to August 1, 2025. Then 12 months due to the schedule ending on August 1, 2026. So in the end, temp 100% runs from June 12, 2025 to August 1, 2026.
- Example rollover: Admitted for surgery February 28, 2025 and released March 2, 2025.

- Effective date of 100% due to 38 CFR 4.30 is February 28, 2025 to May 1, 2025. Then 12 months due to the schedule ending on May 1, 2026. So in the end, temp 100% runs from February 28, 2025 to May 1, 2026.

For the purposes of VA disability. The diagnosis of your actual back condition is generally not all too important in how it is rated. The vast majority of spine conditions will be based upon the Veteran's limitation of Range of Motion (ROM). This is done based upon the Veteran's neck (cervical spine) or rest of the back (thoracolumbar spine).

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- For the purposes of Range of Motion (ROM), the examiner/rater are **REQUIRED** to consider flair ups in your conditions. Meaning, if you do not happen to have an [Examination](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/cnp)  on your worst day, the examiner is required to reasonably estimate your impairment on your worst day! The rater is required to use this estimate, unless your ROM is somehow noted as being worse during ROM testing during the exam. In any event, the rater is to use the most impaired ROM measurements noted by the examiner!

## **5235 through 5242 Ratings Based Off Limitations of Range of Motion (ROM)**

**PYRAMIDING NOTES:**

- Veterans who have disabilities that affect their neck and back **CAN** receive 2 ratings (one for their neck and one for their back)!

- If a Veteran has multiple conditions (DDD, Strain, etc) that affect the same section of spine (neck or middle/lower back). Then they can only get **ONE** rating per section of their spine (neck or middle/lower back)!

- Example: lower back has a diagnosis of strain and DDD, middle back has a diagnosis of DDD, and neck has a diagnosis of DDD. Only two separate ratings can be awarded. One for the neck and another for the middle/lower back.

NOTE:

- In exceptional cases, an examiner may state that because of age, body habitus, neurologic disease, or other factors not the result of disease or injury of the spine, the range of motion of the spine in a particular individual should be considered normal for that individual, even though it does not conform to normal range of motion.

| Rating | Back (Thoracolumbar) | Neck (Cervical) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0% | Forward flexion measures 90Â° or more, **OR** combined ROM measures 240Â° or more. | Forward flexion measure 45Â° or more, **OR** combined ROM measures 340Â° or more. |
| 10% | Forward flexion measures more than 60Â° but not more than 85Â°, **OR** combined ROM is between 125Â° and 240Â°. | Forward flexion measures more than 30Â° but less than 45Â°, **OR** combined ROM is between 175Â° and 340Â°. |
| 20% | Forward flexion measures more than 30Â° but not more than 60Â°, **OR** combined ROM is 120Â° or less. | Forward flexion measures more than 15Â° but not more than 30Â°, **OR** combined ROM is 170Â° or less. |
| 30% | N/A | Forward flexion measures 15Â° or less, **OR** entire cervical spine is frozen in a **favorable** position. |
| 40% | Forward flexion measures 30Â° or less, **OR** entire thoracolumbar spine frozen in a **favorable** position. | Entire cervical spine frozen in an **unfavorable** position. |
| 50% | Entire thoracolumbar spine frozen in an unfavorable position. | N/A |
| 100% | Entire spine frozen in an **unfavorable** position. |

## **5243 Rating Based off Incapacitating Episodes**

If the Veteran is rated for **Intervertebral Disc Syndrome (IVDS)** _and_ has a number of incapacitating episodes within the span of 12 months that require **PRESCRIBED** bed rest, they can be rated based on incapacitating episodes **INSTEAD** of ROM.

Additional names for IVDS include:

- Bulging disc;

- Degenerative Disc Disease (DDD);

- Discogenic pain syndrome;

- Herniated disc;

- Herniated nucleus pulposus;

- Pinched nerve;

- Prolapsed disc;

- Protruded disc;

- Ruptured disc; and

- Slipped disc.

**PYRAMIDING NOTES:**

- The Veteran's ROM rating can be replaced ( **NOT** rated in addition to) with one of these ratings; **Whichever rating is highest!**

- If rated under this schedule, separate ratings for related spine- [Nerve](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/nervsystem)  conditions are **NOT** allowed!

| Rating | Weeks of Rest |
| --- | --- |
| 10% | At least 1 but less than 2. |
| 20% | At least 2 but less than 4. |

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- For the purposes of Range of Motion (ROM), the examiner/rater are **REQUIRED** to consider flair ups in your conditions. Meaning, if you do not happen to have an [Examination](https://www.reddit.com/r/VeteransBenefits/wiki/cnp)  on your worst day, the examiner is required to reasonably estimate your impairment on your worst day! The rater is required to use this estimate, unless your ROM is somehow noted as being worse during ROM testing during the exam. In any event, the rater is to use the most impaired ROM measurements noted by the examiner!

- For Veterans who are ambidextrous, whichever wrist is affected will be considered dominant.

## **5125 Amputation at Wrist**

This schedule is pretty straight forward. However, Veterans must be aware of the _Amputation Rule_. It boils down to a Veteran cannot be rated higher for disabilities of a limb that would [Combine](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/VAMath)  to be more than a Veteran who has had an amputation that resulted in a loss of those areas.

NOTES:

1. Veterans who have also had an amputation/loss of use of their foot in addition to a wrist will receive a singular rating of 100% for both the loss of the hand and foot.

2. Veteran is entitled to [Special Monthly Compensation](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/smc)

| Rating | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 60% | Non-dominant wrist |
| 70% | Dominant wrist |
| 100% | Both wrists. |

<!-- Chunk 511/1206 | Heading: 5125 Amputation at Wrist | Words: 128 -->

---

## **5214 Joint Stiffness (Ankylosis) of Wrist**

When the wrist joint cannot move.

- Deviation: Hand is tilted left or right.

- Dorsiflexion: Palm facing the wall.

- Palmar flexion: Palm faces yourself.

\*Veterans is entitled to [Special Monthly Compensation](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/smc)

| Dominant Rating | Non-Dominant Rating | Degree Stuck |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 30% | 20% | Between 20Â° to 30Â° dorsiflexion. |
| 40% | 30% | Greater than 30Â° dorsiflexion. |
| 50% | 40% | Any degree of palmar flexion, or with ulnar or radial deviation. |
| 70% | 60% | If hand becomes unusable at all\*. |

## **5053 Wrist Replacement (Prosthesis)**

**PYRAMIDING NOTE:**

- If the joint had **ANY** other musculoskeletal evaluations (ankylosis, range of motion, etc.) they **WILL BE** discontinued the date of the procedure!

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- After the temporary 100% ends the Veteran can file for an increase if they feel their symptoms warrant a higher evaluation.

- If this condition could be rated higher under ankylosis, the rater will do so; replacing this evaluation.
- Medical evidence **MUST** show:

- Date of admission;

- Date of discharge;

- Date of surgery; **AND**

- Procedure performed.

- If the procedure is noted for a non-service-connected condition then the VA will get a medical opinion to determine if the non-service-connected condition is a progression of the service-connected condition.

**RATER NOTES:**

- Temp 100% includes a bonus 1 month due to 38 CFR 4.30, so while it says 1 year it is actually 13 months total!

- Example: Admitted for surgery June 12, 2025 and release June 12, 2025.

- Effective date of 100% due to 38 CFR 4.30 is June 12, 2025 to August 1, 2025. Then 12 months due to the schedule ending on August 1, 2026. So in the end, temp 100% runs from June 12, 2025 to August 1, 2026.
- Example rollover: Admitted for surgery February 28, 2025 and released March 2, 2025.

- Effective date of 100% due to 38 CFR 4.30 is February 28, 2025 to May 1, 2025. Then 12 months due to the schedule ending on May 1, 2026. So in the end, temp 100% runs from February 28, 2025 to May 1, 2026.
- Remember to check for temporary entitlement to [SMC S](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/smc#s)  and to discontinue it as appropriate!

- Any residual [Scars](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/skin#7802)

- Temporary 100% **CANNOT** be the basis of the award of [Permanent and Total](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/pnt)  It is in the nameâ€¦

| Dominant Rating | Non-Dominant Rating | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 20% | 20% | Minimum rating. |
| 40% | 30% | Chronic residuals consisting of severe painful motion or weakness in the affected extremity. |
| 100% | 100% | For 12 months following the replacement. After which, Veteran will be rated the minimum. |

## **5215 Ratings Based Off Limitations of Range of Motion (ROM)**

For how much range of motion a normal wrist has. The VA really has an extremely narrow band of consideration. In terms of what constitutes a compensational disability.

**PYRAMIDING NOTE:**

- You **CANNOT** get separate evaluations for dorisflexion and palmar flexion, you get rated under one or the other!

### Miscellaneous

The Veteran will **NOT** receive an additional rating if they fit the criteria of this miscellaneous case. The Veteran will get a single rating for the ROM or Miscellaneous rating; **Whichever rating is higher!**

| Rating | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 10% | Pain with motion. |

<!-- Chunk 516/1206 | Heading: Miscellaneous | Words: 56 -->

### 5013-5024 VA Doing VA Things

While the following conditions in the schedule says to rate these things under degenerative arthritis. It then goes on to say, they _can only be rated upon how they affect range of motion_. Which means they do **NOT** actually receive the major/minor joint treatment.

Yes, it makes no sense.

- Bursitis

- Gout

- Heterotopic ossification

- Myositis

- Myositis ossificans

- Non-cancerous bone growth

- Osteomalacia

- Osteoporosis

- Pagetâ€™s disease (Osteitis deformans)

- Tenosynovitis, tendinitis, tendinosis or tendinopathy

**PRESUMPTIVE CONDITIONS:**

- If diagnosed with _pagetâ€™s disease_ or _osteomalacia_ within a [Year](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/time)  of separation **AND** the severity warranted _at least_ a 10% evaluation within that time.

- [Former POW](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/pow)  for _at least_ 30 days and diagnosed with _osteoporosis_ **AND** the severity warranted _at least_ a 10% evaluation at any time.

- If less than 30 days the Veteran must also have a diagnosis of [PTSD](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)

- Veterans **CANNOT** get separate ratings for these conditions under this schedule, limitation of motion, and frozen joints. The Veteran will get whichever would gives the highest rating.

NOTE:

- If the Veteran no longer rates at least 20% under this schedule they will be rated under the [Degenerative Arthritis/Post-traumatic Arthritis](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/msdiseases#5003)  schedule, limitation of motion, or frozen joints; Whichever would give the highest rating will be the rating the Veteran will get.

* * *

## **5000 Bone Infection (Osteomyelitis)**

**PYRAMIDING NOTE:**

- One of the rare exceptions to the [Pyramiding rule](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/ratingsindex#pyramiding)  The Veteran **IS** allowed to have a rating for the bone infection, any loss of range of motion (or if the joint is frozen), and shortening of the leg, if applicable. However, the Veteran is still subject to the [Amputation rule](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/ratingsindex#amputation)  **UNLESS**, they get a singular rating of 60% or higher evaluation for the bone infection itself.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- If the affected bone is successfully treated (removed) and there are no further infections. The Veteran will **LOSE** their rating for bone infection and will then be rated on any residuals.

| Rating | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 10% | Infection(s) have been inactive for no more than 5 years and there is a medical history of repeated episodes. |

The cranial nerves are those that come directly from the brain, _not_ the spinal cord.

NOTE:

- While there are a total of 12 cranial nerves. Only 6 of them can be rated under this schedule. The other 6 are rated under the [Special senses](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/senses)  schedule.

**PRESUMPTIVE CONDITION:**

- If diagnosed within a [Year](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/time)  of separation **AND** the severity warranted _at least_ a 10% evaluation within that time.

**PYRAMIDING NOTES:**

- The nerve can only be rated under **_ONE_** category **OR** however it affects range of motion (ROM). Whichever will give the Veteran the highest rating.

- However, if the Veteran has a [Musculoskeletal](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/msindex)  issue that can be attributed to the limitation of ROM. Then the Veteran **CAN** get separate ratings for both the nerve **AND** the ROM!
- The Veteran **CAN** get separate evaluations for each of the following 6 nerves.

- There are a _pair_ of nerves (each controlling a side of the body). The Veteran **CAN** get an individual rating for **BOTH** sides affected! Meaning a Veteran can get upwards of a total of 12 separate evaluations! Do know that the cranial nerves however are **NOT** eligible for the [Bilateral factor](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vamath)

The Nerves of the lower back and lower.

* * *

**PYRAMIDING NOTES:**

- Nerves can only be rated under **_ONE_** [Category](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/lownerves#cat)  whichever is the primary disability.

- There are a _pair_ of nerves (each controlling a side of the body). As such, the veteran **CAN** get a separate rating for each leg! Know, the nerves **ARE** eligible for [Bilateral factor](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vamath#bilateral)

**PRESUMPTIVE CONDITION:**

- If diagnosed within a [Year](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/time)  of separation **AND** the severity warranted _at least_ a 10% evaluation within that time;

- If diagnosed within a year of last possible exposure to [Agent Orange](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/agentorange)  **AND** the condition would have rated _at least_ 10% within that year;

- _Neurological signs or symptoms_ if exposed to [Gulf environmental hazards](https://sunflower-brass-pcgs.squarespace.com/gulfill)  and the condition is considered a MUCMI; or

- Was a [POW](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/pow)  for _at least_ 30 days and the severity of the condition was _at least_ 10% at any point.

## **Nerve Groupings**

The following list shows which nerves are allowed to be rated separately and which must be rated together:

Lower extremity nerves boil down to 3 groupings. Nerves within groups 1 and 2 **CANNOT** be rated separately within their own groups. But a nerve in group 1 **CAN** be rated separately from groups 2 and 3; likewise a nerve in group 2 **CAN** be rated separately from groups 1 and 3. Finally, nerves in group 3 **CAN** be rated separately from **ALL** nerves, even those within group 3!

If more than one nerve is impaired within group 1; Veterans gets a single evaluation for group 1; whichever gives the highest evaluation.

If more than one nerve is impaired within group 2; Veterans gets a single evaluation for group 2; whichever gives the highest evaluation.

- Group 1

- [Common Peroneal Nerve (Common Fibular Nerve, External Popliteal Nerve, Lateral Popliteal Nerve, Peroneal Nerve)](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/lownerves#8521)

- [The Deep Peroneal Nerve (Anterior Tibial Nerve, Deep Fibular](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/lownerves#8523)  [Nerve)](https://www.reddit.com/r/VeteransBenefits/wiki/lblnerves/#wiki_the_deep_peroneal_nerve_.28anterior_tibial_nerve.2C_deep_fibular_nerve.29)

## **Categorizes & Severity Explained**

Nerve conditions are placed into 1 of 3 categories which are then rated upon their severity.

**RATER NOTES:**

- _Most_ conditions are simply rated as paralysis of the nerve, as it offers the highest evaluations and generally covers most symptoms.

- If a Veteran has a current diagnosis **AND** reports _any_ symptoms, the severity **MUST** at least be mild! Even if the examiner notes there are no symptoms!

- **NEVER** assign an evaluation _higher than_ moderate if symptoms cannot be tested for or seen; It does **NOT** matter if the Veteran reports severe pain!

- Moderate evaluations and above require symptoms which an examiner can test for. Be it decreased sensitivity, reduced reflexes, muscle weakness/atrophy, impairment of function (shaking, slow movements, joints are stiff), and/or loss of hair growth.

- Do know, even if the Veteran _does_ have a testable symptom; It does **NOT** mean that an evaluation of at least moderate is required or appropriate. There can be cases in which a mild evaluation is still the most appropriate decision.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- There can be a fair bit of differences of opinions as to how to rate nerve severity. So if you got a mild when you thought you should have gotten at least moderate, filing a [Higher level review](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals#hlr)  _may_ be a good idea.

<!-- Chunk 579/1206 | Heading: Categorizes & Severity Explained | Words: 225 -->

---

### Paralysis (1)

Inability to control or sense.

- Incomplete (Mild) - Feelings of tingling or mild pain. Some mild ROM impacts.

- Incomplete (Moderate) - Feelings of tingling, numbness, moderate pain, or other symptoms that do interfere with ability to function.

- Incomplete (Severe) - Ability to function is seriously limited. Symptoms might include things like poor blood circulation and loss of muscle mass.

- Complete - No sensation or control, basically it is gone.

* * *

<!-- Chunk 580/1206 | Heading: Paralysis (1) | Words: 79 -->

---

### Neuritis (2)

Pain or numbness without nerve degeneration or objective signs of nerve dysfunction (the doctor seeing/finding it).

- Mild - Loss of sensation, loss of muscle mass, or loss of reflexes. The total impact does not significantly impacts ability to function.

- Moderate - Loss of sensation, loss of muscle mass, or loss of reflexes. The total impact significantly impacts ability to function.

- Severe - Loss of sensation, loss of muscle mass, and loss of reflexes. The total impact seriously impacts ability to function.

* * *

<!-- Chunk 581/1206 | Heading: Neuritis (2) | Words: 90 -->

---

### Neuralgia (3)

Stabbing, burning, and often severe pain due to an irritated or damaged nerve.

- Mild - Tingling or mild pain. The total impact does not really affect overall function.

- Moderate - Tingling, numbness, or moderate to severe pain. That total impact significantly impacts ability to function.

## **Epilepsy and Seizures**

Epilepsy is defined as a condition that involves having repeated seizure activity.

Seizures are periods of abnormal electrical activity in the brain. The number of symptoms a person who experiences epilepsy and seizures varies but can include:

- Anger;

- Confusion;

- Drooling;

- Falling down;

- Fear;

- Hallucinations;

- Inappropriate behavior;

- Mumbling;

- Severe shaking of the body;

- Sweating; and

- Vomiting.

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- Often those who have epilepsy also have an accompanying mental disorder. If the mental disorder is only present during a seizure then the mental disorder **CANNOT** get it's own individual rating. _However_, if the [Mental disorder](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)  persists between seizures then it **CAN** get it's own individual rating!

- If the above condition is meet and the mental disorder that manifests is a personality disorder. The VA will grant a rating - coding it under [Dementia](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)
- In order for a Veteran to get a diagnosis for epilepsy the Veteran **MUST** have a seizure witnessed by a physician, **OR** verified by a physician. Verification can be done by an electroencephalogram (EEG), which measures electrical activity in the brain.

**PRESUMPTIVE CONDITION:**

- If diagnosed within a [Year](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/time)  of separation **AND** the severity warranted _at least_ a 10% evaluation within that time; or

- [Secondary to a moderate or severe TBI](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/tbi#presumptive)

* * *

<!-- Chunk 632/1206 | Heading: Epilepsy and Seizures | Words: 224 -->

### Rating Seizures

There are two degrees of severity for seizures:

- **Minor** \- seizure affects portions of the brain. Consciousness may be loss temporarily. Symptoms might include mumbling, muscle spasms, blinking rhythmically, staring or nodding of the head, or falling down.

- **Major** \- seizure affects the entire brain. Usually results in the Veteran losing consciousness during the seizure while their body convulses uncontrollably.

If the condition can be rated under either major or minor seizures. The Veteran will get the higher of the 2.

| Rating | Minor Seizures | Major Seizures |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 10% | Requires constant medication or long history of seizures. | "" |
| 20% | 2 in past 6 months. | 1 in 2 years. |
| 40% | 5-8 per week. | 2 in a year. |

### 8100 Migraine Headaches (Tension Headaches, Headaches, etc.)

All varieties of headaches are rated under the migraine schedule.

Ratings are based upon the severity of the headaches as well as their frequency.

The key word the schedule uses is _"Prostrating"_:

- **Prostrating**: The headache is so bad that your when it starts your day is done. You may need to take medication, take the day off and isolate, or seek medical attention. If medication helps, it might have the negative effect of making you too drowsy to do any work or other activities.

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- If the severity is not prostrating then you will **NOT** receive a compensational rating!

- It is important that the Veteran properly document the frequency and severity of their headaches. A lot of Veterans have found the use of various headache tracking/diary apps very helpful in this regard.

- You may also find using [Personal](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/personal)  or [Buddy statements](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/buddy)  helpful in showing the severity and frequency of your headaches.

The nerves of the upper back and arms. These nerves originate from the neck (cervical spine).

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- If a Veteran it ambidextrous then whatever side is affected will be considered dominant.

**PRESUMPTIVE CONDITION:**

- If diagnosed within a [Year](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/time)  of separation;

- If diagnosed within a year of last possible exposure to [Agent Orange](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/agentorange)  **AND** the condition would have rated _at least_ 10% within that year;

- _Neurological signs or symptoms_ if exposed to [Gulf environmental hazards](https://sunflower-brass-pcgs.squarespace.com/gulfill)  and the condition is considered a MUCMI; or

- Was a [POW](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/pow)  for _at least_ 30 days and the severity of the condition was _at least_ 10% at any point.

* * *

**PYRAMIDING NOTES:**

- Nerves can only be rated under **_ONE_** [_C_ ategory](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/upnerves#cat)  whichever is the primary disability.

- There are a _pair_ of nerves (each controlling a side of the body). As such, the veteran **CAN** get a rating for each arm! Know, the nerves **ARE** eligible for [Bilateral factor](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vamath#bilateral)

- You can only get **ONE** nerve evaluation per arm, no matter how many groups/individual nerves are impaired!

<!-- Chunk 665/1206 | Heading: Rating Schedule for The Peripheral Nerves of the Upper Back and Arms | Words: 254 -->

---

## **Groups & Individual Nerve Ratings**

If a group of nerves are damaged they may be rated as a group. To be rated as a group, _most or all_ of the nerves within the group must be affected.

Otherwise, if just some within a group are affected; the Veteran will get a singular evaluation based on the highest rated singular nerve.

## **Categorizes & Severity Explained**

Nerve conditions are placed into 1 of 3 categories which are then rated upon their severity.

**RATER NOTES:**

- _Most_ conditions are simply rated as paralysis of the nerve, as it offers the highest evaluations and generally covers most symptoms.

- If a Veteran has a current diagnosis **AND** reports _any_ symptoms, the severity **MUST** at least be mild! Even if the examiner notes there are no symptoms!

- **NEVER** assign an evaluation _higher than_ moderate if symptoms cannot be tested for or seen; It does **NOT** matter if the Veteran reports severe pain!

- Moderate evaluations and above require symptoms which an examiner can test for. Be it decreased sensitivity, reduced reflexes, muscle weakness/atrophy, impairment of function (shaking, slow movements, joints are stiff), and/or loss of hair growth.

- Do know, even if the Veteran _does_ have a testable symptom; It does **NOT** mean that an evaluation of at least moderate is required or appropriate. There can be cases in which a mild evaluation is still the most appropriate decision.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- There can be a fair bit of differences of opinions as to how to rate nerve severity. So if you got a mild when you thought you should have gotten at least moderate, filing a [Higher level review](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals#hlr)  _may_ be a good idea.

* * *

<!-- Chunk 670/1206 | Heading: Categorizes & Severity Explained | Words: 225 -->

---

### Paralysis (1)

Inability to control or sense.

- Incomplete (Mild) - Feelings of tingling or mild pain. Some mild ROM impacts.

- Incomplete (Moderate) - Feelings of tingling, numbness, moderate pain, or other symptoms that do interfere with ability to function.

- Incomplete (Severe) - Ability to function is seriously limited. Symptoms might include things like poor blood circulation and loss of muscle mass.

- Complete - No sensation or control, basically it is gone.

* * *

<!-- Chunk 671/1206 | Heading: Paralysis (1) | Words: 79 -->

---

### Neuritis (2)

Pain or numbness without nerve degeneration or objective signs of nerve dysfunction (the doctor seeing/finding it).

- Mild - Loss of sensation, loss of muscle mass, or loss of reflexes. The total impact does not significantly impacts ability to function.

- Moderate - Loss of sensation, loss of muscle mass, or loss of reflexes. The total impact significantly impacts ability to function.

- Severe - Loss of sensation, loss of muscle mass, and loss of reflexes. The total impact seriously impacts ability to function.

* * *

<!-- Chunk 672/1206 | Heading: Neuritis (2) | Words: 90 -->

---

### Neuralgia (3)

Stabbing, burning, and often severe pain due to an irritated or damaged nerve.

- Mild - Tingling or mild pain. The total impact does not really affect overall function.

- Moderate - Tingling, numbness, or moderate to severe pain. That total impact significantly impacts ability to function.

When the brain gets damaged as a result of something like:

- Car accident;

- Concussive artillery fire;

- IED blast;

- Fall;

- Gunshot wound;

- etc.

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- If your TBI causes the loss of use or requires aid and attendance you may be entitled to [Special Monthly Compensation](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/smc#t)

- TBI can be one of the most complicated conditions to rate and it is fairly easy for a rater to mess it up. If you feel you were not rated correctly, you may benefit from requesting a [Higher Level Review](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals)

<!-- Chunk 718/1206 | Heading: Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) | Words: 159 -->

---

## **Pyramiding**

The VA is prohibited from assigning multiple ratings for the same symptoms. This is complicated by the fact that TBI's rating criteria is a smoothy mix of symptoms! This is particularly true when it comes to [Area 10](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/tbi#10)

The rater _should_ carefully consider how they rate TBI, to give the Veteran the maximum benefit; Meaning running through various scenarios to see which produces the best outcome. See [Example](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/tbi#example)  for more details.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- The VBA is **PROHIBITED** from awarding vertigo as a separate evaluation from TBI! Even if awarding vertigo would itself be the better evaluation!

- Does it make sense? No butâ€¦ If you fit into this situationâ€¦ you could try appealing to the [Board of Veteran Appeals (BVA)](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals#bva)  since they are **NOT** bound by VBA policy decisions.

### PTSD & TBI

Due to overlapping nature of the symptoms of [PTSD](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/mental#9411)  and TBI. The VA often **WILL** lump a Veteran's PTSD and TBI ratings.

However, **IF** the Veteran's examiner/physician/specialist is able to separate the symptoms of the 2 disorders. The Veteran **CAN** get 2 separate individual ratings!

[Return to top](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/tbi#top)

<!-- Chunk 720/1206 | Heading: PTSD & TBI | Words: 52 -->

---

## **How TBI is Rated**

TBI is rated upon the severity of the residual symptoms a Veteran has. There are a total of 10 areas of impairment that the VA considers. The veteran will be evaluated in each of those 10 areas. The area that has the highest level of impairment will be the the basis of the Veteran's **SINGULAR** TBI rating. **UNLESS** it is more beneficial to break the symptoms into their own separate ratings(s). See [Example](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/tbi#example)  for more details.

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- You are **NOT** going to get 10 individual ratings!

**RATER NOTE:**

- If the examiner notes there are **NO** residual TBI symptoms, but is able to diagnose a TBI ( **EVEN IF ACUTE**) a 0% rating is to be granted (if service-connection is warranted)!

<!-- Chunk 731/1206 | Heading: Subjective Symptoms (Area 10) | Words: 205 -->

## **TBI Rating Example**

Veteran has the following symptoms:

- Sensitivity to light: 0%

- [Headaches](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/cns#8100)  30%

- Social Interaction (Area 3): 40%

- Subjective Symptoms (Area 10): 10%

- [Tinnitus](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/ears#6260)  10%

- [PTSD](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/mental#9411)  70%

- [Vision impairment](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/eyes)  0%

Is examiner able to separate TBI and mental health symptoms?: **NO**

Okay so lets start cutting this apart!

So social interactions and PTSD are same set of symptoms, we **CANNOT** award a separate ratings for those within consideration! So lets cross those out and set _aside_ PTSD.

- Sensitivity to light: 0%

- [Headaches](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/cns#8100)  30%

- Social Interaction (Area 3): 40%

- Subjective Symptoms (Area 10): 10%

- [Tinnitus](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/ears#6260)  10%

- [PTSD: 70%](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/mental#9411)
- [Vision impairment](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/eyes)  0%

Looking at the TBI areas, we only have area 10 left. However, since the subjective symptoms (headaches, and tinnitus) themselves will rate higher under their own schedules we can cross those out and set them aside.

- Sensitivity to light: 0%

- [Headaches](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/cns#8100)  30%
- Social Interaction (Area 3): 40%

- Subjective Symptoms (Area 10): 10%

- [Tinnitus](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/ears#6260)  10%

- [PTSD: 70%](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/mental#9411)
- [Vision impairment](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/eyes)  0%

We still have sensitivity to light and vision impairment and area 10 remaining. But wait! We need to go back to the area 10 part of the schedule and re-run it! Since we parted out the other subjective symptoms, area 10 now rates 0%.

So how does our end rating look?

It would look like this:

| Rating | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| 70% | PTSD. |
| 30% | Headaches. |
| 10% | Tinnitus. |
| 0% | Residuals of Traumatic Brain Injury with sensitivity to light and vision impairment. |

## **Common Secondary Conditions**

Due to the TBI rating consisting of a whole host of symptoms. If the TBI is shown to be the cause of secondary conditions. Those secondary conditions _can_ be service-connected.

Again, be aware of pyramiding - the Veteran **CANNOT** have the same symptom rated twice!

### **Presumptive Secondary Conditions**

In 2014, Congress [Recognized](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/38/3.310)  that there was enough evidence to support the establishment of several presumptive conditions for those who experienced varying degrees of TBI.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- If there is clear evidence that the condition was _more likely_ caused by another after service TBI, disease, etc. Then service-connection _can_ still be denied!

The following 5 conditions are those that have been recognized as being presumptive. Each with their own rules. Such as the severity of the TBI experienced during service as well as the time frame in which the condition needs to be diagnosed **_since the TBI event_**.

1. [Parkinson's disease](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/cns#8004)  \- moderate or severe TBI (during life of Veteran).

2. [Seizures](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/cns#8103)  \- moderate or severe TBI (during life of Veteran).

3. [Dementia (Alzheimer's disease)](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)  \- moderate or severe TBI (within 15 years).

4. [Depression](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)  \- mild (within 1 year) moderate or severe TBI (within 3 years).

5. Hormone deficiencies due to damage to the [Pituitary gland](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/endsystem#7916)  or the hypothalamus - moderate or severe TBI (within 1 year).

#### Severity of TBI

The severity is determined during the time surrounding the events immediately following the TBI event.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- The Veteran only needs to meet **ONE** bullet in a category to fall within it.

- Mild:

- Brain was normal when imaged;

- Veteran lost consciousness for 30 minutes or less;

- Veteran was disoriented, confused, had trouble thinking clearly, or similar for 24 hours or less;

- Veteran had amnesia for 1 day or less; or

- [Glasgow Coma Scale](https://www.cdc.gov/masstrauma/resources/gcs.pdf)  is 13 â€“ 15.
- Moderate:

- Brain was abnormal when imaged;

- Veteran lost consciousness for 30 minutes but less than 24 hours;

- Veteran was disoriented, confused, had trouble thinking clearly, or similar for more than 24 hours;

- Veteran had amnesia for more than 1 day but less than 7 days; or

- Glasgow Coma Scale is 9 â€“ 12.
- Severe:

- Veteran lost consciousness for more than 24 hours;

- Veteran had amnesia for 7 days or more; or

- Glasgow Coma Scale is 3 â€“ 8.

## **Unemployability**

As you saw the TBI schedule is a bit all over the place and is _not_ particularly great at compensating Veterans.

However, if your TBI and/or your other service-connected disabilities make you unable to hold down gainful employment. You should apply for [Total Disability based on Individual Unemployability (TDIU)](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/tdiu)

## **Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQs)**

To get an idea of how a [C&P exam](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/cnp)  will be conducted it is recommended that the Veteran look at the applicable DBQ.

Veteran's may ask a physician to complete a DBQ on their behalf to submit with their claim. For more information on DBQs click [HERE](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/dbq)

<!-- Chunk 754/1206 | Heading: Rating Schedule for the Respiratory System | Words: 79 -->

## **GENERAL PYRAMIDING NOTES:**

- Under this schedule the Veteran **CANNOT** receive multiple individual ratings for conditions _besides_ in the following cases:

- Diseases of the Nose & Sinuses

- Diseases of the Throat
- Lung cancers or tumors, **CANNOT** be given separate ratings if there is already a rating for respiratory condition ( **EXCEPT** nose, sinuses, and throat conditions).

Otherwise the Veteran can only have one individual respiratory rating. I.E. either a rating for sleep apnea **OR** asthma - You **CANNOT** separate ratings for both!

- If the secondary respiratory condition affects the Veteran's overall health _significantly_, then the rating for the dominant respiratory condition can be increased to the next higher rating in the schedule (not just with an added 10%).

- **HOWEVER**, the rater **CANNOT** consider subjective symptoms _or_ symptoms that overlap between the respiratory conditions.
- Separate ratings for Sinusitis and Rhinitis **ARE ALLOWED**! You just can't get say 2 ratings for different types of sinusitis or rhinitis.

<!-- Chunk 755/1206 | Heading: GENERAL PYRAMIDING NOTES: | Words: 162 -->

---

## **Evaluation Vocabulary to Know**

- Diffusion Capacity of the Lung for Carbon Monoxide by the Single Breath Method (DLCO (SB)). In addition to testing the function of the airways, this test also measures the ability of the lungs to absorb gasses. After inhaling a certain amount of carbon monoxide, the test measures how much is absorbed by the lungs into the blood stream by measuring how much is left in the air that is exhaled.

- Results of this test would be a percentage of how you would compare to a healthy person. 80% and above is considered normal.
- Exercise test - determines how much oxygen your body uses when functioning at its maximum capacity.

- Results of this test look like: _XX ml/kg/min_.
- Heart test - if the heart is involved in the respiratory condition a echocardiogram (ECG or EKG), cardiac catheterization, or other tests of the heart may be done.

- Spirometry - determines the functioning of the lungs and the airways leading to the lungs. This test should be done **BEFORE** and **AFTER** you take medication!

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- In terms of rating - if this test is used to evaluate conditions under diagnostic codes (DC) 6600, 6603, 6604, 6825-6833, and 6840-6845, then the results with the **AFTER** medication results will be used (if medication is used); **UNLESS** the medication made your results worse!

The following are results that are generated from spirometry tests:

- Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) - the total maximum amount of air that you can exhale after taking a full breath.

- Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV-1) - the maximum amount of air that you can blow out in 1 second.

- Results of this measurement would be a percentage of how you would compare to a healthy person. 70% and above is considered normal.
- Ratio of FEV-1 to Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) - determined by dividing the FEV-1 by the FVC.

### Upper Airway Resistance Syndrome (UARS)

Represents a progression toward the potential development of sleep apnea, caused by snoring.

However, UARS, in and of itself, does **NOT** meet the criteria of sleep-disordered breathing that defines sleep apnea and is **NOT** considered a ratable disability for compensation purposes.

If you have a diagnosis for UARS, you should wait on submitting a [Claim](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vaclaim)  till/if you get a diagnosis of sleep apnea.

### 6847 Sleep Apnea (SA, Obstructive, Central, Mixed)

When you stop breathing while you sleep or your breathing becomes insufficient leading to low blood oxygen levels.

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- The VA **MUST** have a sleep study! Otherwise they **CANNOT** grant service-connection.

- Home sleep studies _are_ acceptable if:

- It has been clinically determined that the Veteran can be appropriately evaluated by a home sleep study; and

- A competent medical provider has evaluated the results.
- The Veteran only needs to be prescribed a CPAP machine to rate 50%. While it would be a good idea to use it, for your health and all. It is **NOT** a requirement to use it to maintain this rating.

NOTES:

- Other qualifying breathing assistance devices include:

- Other positive airway pressure machines (automatic positive airway pressure device (APAP); bilevel positive airway pressure device (BiPAP));

- Positive airway pressure machines may also be called non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) or non-invasive ventilation (NIV).
- Nasopharyngeal appliances (nasal dilators; nasopharyngeal stents);

- Oral appliances (mandibular advancement devices (MAD)); tongue-retaining mouthpieces); and

- Implanted genioglossal nerve stimulation devices.

| Rating | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 0% | No symptoms, but there is a diagnosis. |
| 30% | Persistent sleepiness during the daytime or not feeling rested after sleeping. |
| 50% | Requires use of breathing assistance device such as continuous airway pressure (CPAP) machine. |
| 100% | Chronic respiratory failure with carbon dioxide retention or cor pulmonale, **OR**; requires tracheostomy. |

### 6100 Hearing Loss (Hearing Impairment)

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- The VA considers **BOTH** ears when assigning a rating for hearing loss. As such, the Veteran **CANNOT** get single rating for each ear.

- If an ear is **NOT** service connected it is considered to be 100% **PERFECT** working order for rating purposes! (unless special conditions are meet, see special note at bottom of schedule)

- If the examiner does **NOT** test one ear (no results for one ear), the rater is instructed to assume that the untested ear is in 100% **PERFECT** working order!

- In case the examiner forgets to tell you: **REMOVE** your hearing aids **BEFORE** you start the examination!

- Depending on your [MOS](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/loud)  and/or [Combat](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/CombatVet)  experiences, your claim of hearing loss may be given additional weight for consideration for service-connection. Which is _not_ to say, if your MOS is not considered at high risk for noise exposure or that you did not see combat that you cannot get service connection.

In order to get a proper rating the audiologist conducting the [Examination](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/Cnp)  will conduct two tests to determine your hearing loss.

- Speech discrimination - your ability to understand spoken words. Your examiner will say a word and you repeat it.

- Your responses are then calculated as a percentage (higher percent, meaning better hearing).
- Puretone audiometry test - your ability to hear tones. You will sit in a box and press a button when you hear a tone.

- The tones the VA cares about are 4000, 3000, 2000, and 1000Hz. The results from those tones (how loud the tone had to be before you heard it) are then added together and divided by 4 to give you your average. The lower the number is, the better your hearing is.

**PRESUMPTIVE CONDITION:**

- Hearing loss is considered a [Presumptive condition](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/time)  if it manifests within _one year_ of separation, **AND** the severity warranted _at least_ a 10% evaluation within that time.

NOTE:

- If you have disabilities that make it impossible/difficult to complete the speech discrimination test you will be rated based on just the puretone test results.

<!-- Chunk 806/1206 | Heading: 6100 Hearing Loss (Hearing Impairment) | Words: 353 -->

---

#### Puretone and Speech Discrimination Table

NOTES:

- The Roman numerals are purely to help improve readability.

- The higher the numeral, the worse the hearing is.

Using the results of both tests the VA will the following table then determine the severity of your hearing loss for _each_ ear:

| Puretone Threshold Average â†’ | 0-41 | 42-49 | 50-57 | 58-65 | 66-73 | 74-81 | 82-89 | 90-97 | 98+ |

| 0-34 | IX | X | XI | XI | XI | XI | XI | XI | XI |

<!-- Chunk 807/1206 | Heading: Puretone and Speech Discrimination Table | Words: 299 -->

---

#### Puretone only table

If only the puretone test was done. The following table will be used to determine the severity of the Veteran's hearing loss for _each_ ear:

| Puretone Threshold Average â†’ | 0-41 | 42-48 | 49-55 | 56-62 | 63-69 | 70-76 | 77-83 | 84-90 | 91-97 | 98-104 | 105+ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Roman Numerals â†’ | I | II | III | IV | V | VI | VII | VIII | IX | X | XI |

<!-- Chunk 808/1206 | Heading: Puretone only table | Words: 109 -->

---

#### Rating Table

Now that you have evaluated the hearing in **BOTH** ears you can _finally_ use the rating table to determine your evaluation!

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- You **MUST** have hearing loss that meets one of the following criteria to rate at least 0%, otherwise you do **NOT** have hearing loss of VA purposes:

- Auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz is **40 decibels or greater**;

- Auditory thresholds for _at least three_ of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz are **26 decibels or greater**; or

- Speech recognition scores are less than 94 percent.

**_SPECIAL NOTE:_**

If one ear is service-connected and the other ear is not. The VA **CAN** consider the non service-connected ear as service-connected for the purposes of determining an evaluation so long as:

- The non service-connected ear was **NOT** due willful misconduct;

- The non service-connected ear has hearing loss for VA purposes; **AND**

- The service-connected ear rates at least 10% by itself.

## **Balance Disorders**

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- Vertigo is considered a symptom of another condition. For VBA purposes, this means a diagnosis of vertigo itself **CANNOT** be granted a separate evaluation secondary to another condition! In practice - if your vertigo is due to your [Tinnitus](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/ears#6260)  for instance then it will be rated as â€œtinnitus with vertigoâ€ with a maximum evaluation of 10% - **UNLESS** you meet the requirements for [Extra scheduler](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/ratingsindex#extra)  considerations.

- **ONLY** the [Board of Veterans Appeals (BVA)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals#bva)  and higher courts are allowed to grant secondary vertigo as a separate evaluation.
- [Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBI)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/tbi)  are **NOT** allowed to be rated [Analogously](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/diagnosticcodes#analog)  as a balance disorder **EVEN IF** doing so would result in a higher evaluation.

### 6204 Peripheral Vestibular Disorders (PVD)

Conditions that affect the earsâ€™ ability to sense balance.

Symptoms include:

- Dizziness - sensation or perception of unsteadiness, imbalance, or potential unconsciousness

- Vertigo - sensation or perception you/or objects are spinning or moving

- Motion sickness

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- In order to be rated at least 10% under this schedule the Veteran's condition **MUST** be diagnosed via some form of objective testing, **NOT** just the Veteran's subjective reports of dizziness!

| Rating | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 10% | Occasional dizziness. |

### 6205 Meniereâ€™s Syndrome (Endolymphatic Hydrops)

An inner ear disorder that causes episodes of vertigo (spinning).

Symptoms include:

- Dizziness - sensation or perception of unsteadiness, imbalance, or potential unconsciousness

- Hearing loss

- Tinnitus

- Vertigo - sensation or perception you/or objects are spinning or moving

**PYRAMIDING NOTE:**

- This condition can be rated one of two ways, depending on which produces the highest combined rating for the Veteran:

1. One rating under this schedule; **OR**

2. Up to three individual ratings for: [Hearing loss](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/ears#6100)  [Tinnitus](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/ears#6260)  [Peripheral vestibular disorder](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/ears#6204)  The (up to 3) ratings are then combined to determine if they would be higher than the rating under this schedule. If it is a higher result with them being combined, the rater will award the (up to 3) separate evaluations. For information on how the VA combines evaluations click [HERE](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vamath)

## **Visual Impairment Rating System**

If you thought the [Hearing rating system](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/ears#6100)  was complicated... buckle in tight. This is undoubtedly the most complicated system devised to rate a condition.

There are three different ways to rate visual impairment:

1. [Central Visual Acuity](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/eyes#central)

2. [Visual Field](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/eyes#field)

3. [Muscle Dysfunction](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/eyes#muscle)

And since we know Veterans can be impaired in more than one measure:

- [Muscle Dysfunction and Central Visual Acuity](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/eyes#mc)

- [Muscle Dysfunction and Visual Field](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/eyes#mv)

- [Muscle Dysfunction, Central Visual Acuity, and Visual Field](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/eyes#all)

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- If an eye has a condition that affects muscle dysfunction _and_ central visual acuity or visual field. The Veteran will **NOT** get a separate rating for muscle dysfunction. Instead, the Veteran's visual rating(s) could be increased.

- If only one eye is affected and the other eye is _VA_ normal (at least 20/40 corrected vision), then the combined rating of both visual acuity and visual field (including any increase from muscle function) the visual impairment rating for the eye **CANNOT** be higher than 30%! This does **NOT** include other possible eye condition ratings.

- If only one eye is service-connected for visual impairment. The other eye for rating purposes is considered to be at 20/40.

- **UNLESS**, the service-connected **AND** non-service-connected eye has a visual acuity of 20/200 or less; **OR** the peripheral field of vision for each eye is 20 degrees or less. Then the non-service connected eye **WILL** be considered service-connected for rating purposes.

<!-- Chunk 835/1206 | Heading: Visual Impairment Rating System | Words: 242 -->

### Impairment of Central Visual Acuity

How focused or blurry something is when looking _straight_ at it 'central vision'.

This is your typical vision test. It runs on the familiar 20/20 scale. So the worse the vision is, the smaller the number. e.g. 20/100 (0.2) is worse than 20/50 (0.4).

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- Your rating is based upon **CORRECTED DISTANCE VISION**. So if your distance vision is more or less good in _both_ eyes with glasses... well enjoy your low rating.

- Again, for the purposes of the VA, normal vision is 20/40. If you only have one eye examined and not the other. The rater is instructed to assume that eye is normal. Barring of course a note stating the Veteran is missing said eye.

\*Veteran is entitled to [Specially Adapted Housing (SAH)](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/housing#sah)

\*\*No more than light perception.

\*\*\*Veteran is entitled to [Special Monthly Compensation](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/smc#k)

**SPECIAL NOTES:**

- In the event the Veteran's _corrected_ distance and near vision are two or more steps (e.g. 20/40 distance and 20/70 near) different **FOR THE SAME EYE**. The Veteran's _corrected distance_ vision will be rated as one step worse (e.g. 20/50, in our example).

- Eye prescriptions are measured in diopters. They can be a negative or positive number, depending how your vision is being corrected. If the difference in diopter numbers between both eyes are _greater_ than three (e.g. -5.0 to get a corrected vision of 20/40 and -1.5 to get a corrected vision of 20/20). The **WORST EYE** can be rated based upon the uncorrected vision!

- This can **ONLY** be applied if **BOTH** eyes are service-connected for visual impairment!
- In the event one service connected eye has been removed and an artificial one (prosthesis) **CANNOT** be used. The Veteran's rating will be increased by 10% (real math, not [VA math](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vamath)  Though, the rating cannot exceed 100%.

- This is permitted in conjunction with a rating for [Disfigurement](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/skin#7800)  However the disfigurement rating can then **NOT** be based upon gross distortion or asymmetry of the eye. But it still **CAN** be rated based on other characteristics of disfigurement.

### Impairment of Visual Field

How much your eye can see overall. When you look forward, the things you see outside your immediate area of focus. Like those shadows I see at night... the ones just out of the corner of my eyes.

Below is an example of a chart used to determine field of vision:

* * *

The chart contains concentric circles and 8 lines radiating from the center. Each line representing a direction within the field of vision (Up, down, temporal (away from the nose), nasally, and the directions in between those points).

The test itself involves lights that are moved closer and closer till the Veteran can see the a part of the ring in their vision. Depending how affected the Veteran's field of vision is. The resulting 'ring' of vision can be quite distorted.

- For an example of how a rating for impairment of visual field is figured out from the chart click [HERE](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/fieldex)

<!-- Chunk 838/1206 | Heading: Impairment of Visual Field | Words: 160 -->

---

#### 6080 Ratings for Impairment of Visual Field

The Veteran can get a rating based upon **ONE** of the following:

1. Losses of entire section(s) of vision (usually the result of [Brain trauma](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/tbi)  or

2. Average concentric contraction

- The schedule does **NOT** have considerations for Veterans who have eyes of differing averages outside the following listings. If such a situation occurs, the Veteran would have **EACH** eye rated separately; with each eye getting their own _separate_ _rating_.

NOTE:

- 6081 Scotoma has a **MINIMUM** rating of 10% (per eye) **_IF_** 1/4th of visual field (quadrantanopsia) is affected **OR** the blind spots are located within the 30Â° circle.

- If scotoma would rater higher on the under [Central Visual Acuity impairment](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/eyes#central)  it will be rated under that schedule instead.

| One Eye Rating | Both Eyes Rating | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Losses of Entire Halves of Field of Vision** |
| 10% | 10% | Loss of nasal half. |
| 10% | 10% | Loss of top half. |
| 10% | 30% | Loss of bottom half. |
| 10% | 30% | Loss of temporal half. |
| N/A | 30% | Homonymous hemianopsia - Both the right or left halves are lost in both eyes. |
| **Average Concentric Contraction** |
| 10% | 10% | 46-60Â°. |
| 10% | 30% | 31-45Â°. |
| 10% | 50% | 16-30Â°. |
| 20% | 70% | 6-15Â°. |

### 6090, 6092 Muscle Dysfunction AKA Double Vision (Diplopia)

When your eye muscles can't properly track and focus on objects. Resulting most commonly in double vision (diplopia)

Below is an example of a chart (colorized) used to determine muscle dysfunction:

Similar to the one used in the field of vision test. However, the key parts are the 4 quadrants (up, temporally, down, and nasally) and the semi circles within them.

The colors correspond to values in the below table:

| Color | Assigned Visual Acuity |
| --- | --- |
| Green | 20/40 |
| Blue | 20/70 |
| Purple | 20/100 |
| Yellow | 20/200 |
| Orange | 15/200 |
| Red | 5/200 |

<!-- Chunk 840/1206 | Heading: 6090, 6092 Muscle Dysfunction AKA Double Vision (Diplopia) | Words: 140 -->

---

#### Ratings for Muscle Dysfunction

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- If double vision comes and goes **OR** is correctable with glasses a **0%** rating is assigned.

- **The following ratings are for ONLY for those with just muscle dysfunction(s).**

- If the Veteran has **BOTH** a muscle dysfunction _with_ a [Central visual acuity issue](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/eyes#central)  **OR** a [Field of vision issue](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/eyes#field)  **OR** [All the above](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/eyes#all)  **IN EITHER OR BOTH EYES** they are instead rated on those linked schedules.
- Only **ONE** rating can be given for muscle dysfunction, even if both eyes are impaired by muscle dysfunction (you get the worst of the 2).

| Muscle Dysfunction Assigned Visual Acuity â†’ | 20/40 | 20/50 | 20/70 | 20/100 | 20/200 | 15/200 | 10/200 | 5/200 |

### Muscle Dysfunction and Central Visual Acuity

When the Veteran has both muscle dysfunction and central visual acuity issues.

Go through the following steps:

1. Figure out the [Central visual acuity](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/eyes#central)  of **BOTH** eyes.

2. Figure out the _assigned visual acuity_ for [Muscle dysfunction](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/eyes#muscle)  Remember, only the most impacted eye gets an assigned visual acuity! Even if both eyes have dysfunction.

3. Plug the assigned visual acuity you got from muscle dysfunction into the following table and note how many steps you get:

| Assigned Visual Acuity | Steps |
| --- | --- |
| 20/40 or 20/50 | None. |
| 20/70 or 20/100 | 1. |
| 20/200 or 15/200 | 2. |
| 10/200 or 5/200 | 3. |

4\. This may sound odd, because... it is. But, no matter which eye was found to have the worse muscle dysfunction. Apply the number of steps you got from step 3 and apply it to the **WORST** eye's central acuity number. (i.e. if the worst eye had a central visual acuity of 20/50 and you got 2 steps. It would be stepped to 20/100.)

NOTE:

- The step(s) cannot take a central visual acuity below 5/200.

5\. Use the below table to determine your rating.

### Muscle Dysfunction and Visual Field

When the Veteran has both muscle dysfunction and visual field issues.

Go through the following steps:

1. [Calculate impairment of visual field](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/fieldex)

2. Convert the impairment using the following table:

* * *

| Visual Field Impairment | Visual Acuity Equivalent |
| --- | --- |
| Loss of top half | 20/50 |
| Loss of nasal half | 20/50 |
| Loss of temporal half | 20/70 |
| Loss of bottom half | 20/70 |
| More than 61Â° | 20/40 |
| 46-60Â° | 20/50 |
| 31-45Â° | 20/70 |
| 16-30Â° | 20/100 |
| 6-15Â° | 20/200 |
| Less than 6Â° | 5/200 |

3\. Figure out the _assigned visual acuity_ for [Muscle dysfunction](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/muscleex)  Remember, only the most impacted eye gets an assigned visual acuity! Even if both eyes have dysfunction.

4\. Plug the assigned visual acuity you got from muscle dysfunction into the following table and note how many steps you get:

| Assigned Visual Acuity | Steps |
| --- | --- |
| 20/40 or 20/50 | None. |
| 20/70 or 20/100 | 1. |
| 20/200 or 15/200 | 2. |
| 10/200 or 5/200 | 3. |

5\. This may sound odd, because... it is. But, no matter which eye was found to have the worse muscle dysfunction. Apply the number of steps you got from step 3 and apply it to the **WORST** eye's central acuity number. (i.e. if the worst eye had a central visual acuity of 20/50 and you got 2 steps. It would be stepped to 20/100.)

NOTE:

## **Incapacitating Episodes**

Just when you thought you we were done. There is one final thing to consider.

If the Veteran experiences incapacitating episodes they can be rated under this schedule _instead_ of visual impairment. The Veteran will keep whichever method produces the highest rating.

Under this schedule incapacitating episodes are defined as:

- The eye condition becomes so severe that you are required to go to a physician for treatment.

- This does **NOT** have to be emergency care.

- Just going to a physician for treatment itself is not good enough... You actually have to have a treatment preformed. So, if they refuse to treat you or you refuse treatment for whatever reason. That visit will not count as an incapacitating episode.
- Treatments may include but are not limited to:

- Immunosuppressant or biologic agents

- Injections into the eye area

- Laser treatments

- Surgeries

| Rating | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 10% | 1-2 episodes a year. |
| 20% | 3-4 episodes a year. |
| 40% | 5-6 episodes a year. |
| 60% | 7 or more episodes a year. |

As smell and taste are closely linked to one another it is not uncommon if someone losses their sense of smell to also lose their sense of taste or vice versa.

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- The loss of these senses _must_ be non-stop. So any temporary losses due to something like a cold or [Rhinitis](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/airsystem#6522)  is **NOT** rateable.

- The loss of either of these two senses are **NOT** eligible for [Special Monthly Compensation K](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/smc#k)

- DoD does **NOT** consider this schedule when assigning ratings. If anything, the DoD might consider the loss of these senses as a benefit.

## **Estimating Skin Surface Area and Percentages of Total Body**

These are the _estimated figures_ the VA uses when determining how much of your total body is affected.

NOTE:

- Estimates _are_ applied equally to both males _and_ females.

- \\* = Body location is considered _exposed_.

- \*\*= These are the estimates for one limb, **NOT** both!

- \*\*\*= Body location is considered _exposed_ and these are the estimates for one limb, **NOT** both!

| Body Location | Area Size | % of Total Body |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Front of Head\* | 92 in2 | 3.5% |
| Back of Head\* | 92 in2 | 3.5% |
| Front of Neck\* | 26 in2 | 1% |
| Back of Neck\* | 26 in2 | 1% |
| Front of Torso | 343 in2 | 13% |

### Example: Calculating Estimated Skin Surface Area and Percentages of Total Body

1\. Identify which area(s) of skin are affected.

- In the above example:

- Front of Torso and Genitalia are affected.

2\. Shape off sections of affected skin, so you can measure the area. If the area has does not allow for a single square/rectangle/triangle. Then you will need to make several shapes to get a more accurate estimate.

3\. Find the area of your shapes. Time to take off your socks and do some math! Measure the area(s) of the affected skin.

- In our pictured example:

- Front of Torso is 7"x8" so area is 56 inÂ².

- Genitalia is 5"x5" so area is 25 inÂ².

**Math Reminders**

- Square and rectangles: width times length.

- Right angle triangle: width times length then divide the area by 2.

- So if the length and width are 2" and 5" multiply to get an area of 10 inÂ² _then_ divide the area by 2 to get a final area of 5 inÂ².

4\. Add your areas per body section If your skin condition is made up of multiple shapes, add those areas together per [Body section](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/skin#estimate)

- In our pictured example:

We did not have multiple areas of the same body sections affected. So no work for us to do here.

- Total Front of Torso: 56 inÂ².

- Total Genitalia: 25 inÂ².

5\. Calculate total area of _exposed skin_ Remember, the body sections considered exposed are:

- Front of Head;

- Back of Head;

- Front of Neck;

- Back of Neck;

- Back of Hand/Fingers; and

- Palm of Hand/Fingers.

**Add** up the areas of all exposed body sections then **divide** by **368in** Â². Now multiply that answer by **100** to get a percentage of exposed skin that is affected.

If your combined exposed area was 120 inÂ². We would do 120/368 to get 0.3260. Then multiply 0.3260 by 100 to get 32.60%.

Giving us a total area of exposed skin of 32.6%.

- However, in our pictured example: We did not have any areas of exposed skin.

6\. Calculate total area of affected skin

**Add** up all the areas of all body sections then **divide** by **2636in** Â². Now multiply that answer by **100** to get a percentage of total skin that is affected.

- In our pictured example:

- Total Front of Torso: 56 inÂ² + Total Genitalia: 25 inÂ² = 81 inÂ²

- 81 inÂ² /2636 inÂ² = 0.0307 times 100 = 3.07%

- Percentage of Total Body affected is 3.07%

With the percentages of total body and possibly exposed skin. You can now use the [General rating formula](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/skin#general)  to determine your rating.

## **General Rating Formula For The Skin**

Most conditions are rated under this general rating formula.

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- If the condition would rate higher under [Scars and Disfigurement Involving the Head, Face, or Neck](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/skin#7800)  then it can be rated under that schedule instead ( **NOT** in addition to).

- This does **NOT** apply to [Diseases of keratinization (including icthyoses, Darier's disease, and palmoplantar keratoderma)](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/skin#7824)

**PRESUMPTIVE CONDITION:**

- Diagnosed with [Porphyria cutanea tarda](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/skin#7816)  within a year of last possible exposure to [Agent Orange](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/agentorange)  **AND** the condition rates _at least_ 10% within that time.

| Rating | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 0% | Requires the use of topical medications at least once over a 12-month period, or the lesions cover less than 5% of total body, or less than 5% of exposed areas. |
| 10% | Lesions cover 5 to 19% of total body or 5 to 19% of exposed areas; _or_ if it requires the use of systemic therapy for a total of less than 6 weeks over a 12-month period. |
| 30% | Lesions cover 20 to 40% of total body or 20 to 40% of exposed areas; _or_ if it requires the use of systemic therapy for a total of 6 weeks or more over a 12-month period. |
| 60% | Lesions cover more than 40% of total body or more than 40% of exposed areas; _or_ if it requires the constant or near-constant use of systemic therapy for a 12-month period. |

**PYRAMIDING NOTES:**

<!-- Chunk 904/1206 | Heading: General Rating Formula For The Skin | Words: 254 -->

---

### **Single Ratings**

- Single condition that affects multiple areas of skin.

- Multiple conditions that affect the **SAME** areas of skin - the Veteran will get a _single_ rating (the highest of the conditions).

- Skin conditions and scars caused by those conditions **CANNOT** be rated separately unless stated otherwise.

- If medication usage is the basis of a rating; then all skin conditions that are treated by the **SAME** medication will be lumped together.

<!-- Chunk 905/1206 | Heading: Single Ratings | Words: 76 -->

---

### **Multiple Ratings**

Can be given if:

- Each condition has a clear and distinct diagnosis **AND** each condition affects a **DIFFERENT** areas of skin.

**RATER NOTE:**

- If assigning the Veteran a single ratings per condition _instead_ of multiple would be more advantageous the VA will do so.

The Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) uses the [Schedule For Rating Disabilities](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-38/chapter-I/part-4)  in conjunction with the [M21-1 Adjudication Procedures Manual](https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018/topic/554400000004049/M21-1-Adjudication-Procedures-Manual)  to determine what disability evaluation to award Veterans depending upon the severity of their disability and any other applicable policies and regulations.

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- **DO NOT** misuse the schedule! To misrepresent the severity of your condition is a **CRIME**!

- **DO** **NOT** treat the schedule as a check list of things to say _or_ do!

- Please use the schedule more as a means to understand what the VA is looking for. So you have a better understanding of how to explain your impairment or to simply learn how your condition is rated.

## **Extra Scheduler (38 CFR 3.321(b))**

In exceptional or unusual circumstances in which the Veteran has factors such as marked interference with employment or frequent periods of hospitalization, the VA Director of Compensation Service may grant a rating that is higher than what is provided for in the rating schedule. Do know, these cases are exceptionally rare!

## **Hospitalizations (Temporary 100% Rating) (38 CFR 4.29)**

Veterans who are hospitalized at a VA hospital or at an approved hospital for **22 or more** _continuous_ days due to a service-connected condition will be paid at the **100% rate**, going back to the day that they were admitted to the hospital.

This 100% rating will be paid to the end of the month that the Veteran was discharged in and the Veteran will have their evaluation returned to what it was previously\*.

\*Unless the hospitalization lasted at least 6 months due to a [Mental disorder](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)  In such case, the Veteran will continue to receive the 100% rating for 6 months, at which point the Veteran will receive a [Reevaluation](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/cnp)  to determine their current level of disability.

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- The following situations do **NOT** entitle the Veteran to temporary 100%:

- Treatment while a resident in a [State Veteransâ€™ home](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/elderlt#state)

- **UNLESS** actually hospitalized at a medical facility at the home.
- Participating in a live-in/work-out program - used commonly to help transition people to community living; or are

- Resident in a [Domiciliary program](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/38/17.30)

- **UNLESS** the level of care required is comparable to hospital care.

NOTE:

- [VHAâ€™s Mental Health Residential Rehabilitation Treatment Program (MH RRTP)](https://www.mentalhealth.va.gov/get-help/va-residential-rehabilitation/index.asp)  is a type of domiciliary care.

- Depending upon the Veteran's other ratings they may become eligible for [SMC S](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/smc#s)  during their period of convalescence.

### Filing for Temporary 100%

The Veteran can seek the aid of a [VSO](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vso)  or file online on VA.gov. If you file yourself, you can file it as a new claim â€œtemporary 100% due to hospitalizationâ€ and include evidence of the hospitalization or give the VA a [VA Form 21-4142/21-4142a](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/vba-21-4142-are.pdf)  to obtain the records for you.

In order for the VA to grant the temporary 100% the medical evidence **MUST** state:

- The condition(s) which were the cause of the hospitalization; and

- The length of the hospitalization stay.

NOTE:

- If the Veteran is hospitalized at a VA facility, the VA should handle the claim for the Veteran. In this case the Veteran _should_ not need to file themselves.

## **Convalescent Rating (Temporary 100% Rating) (38 CFR 4.30)**

If the Veteran meets at least **ONE** of the following eligibility requirements following their hospital discharge they will be entitled to a temporary single rating of 100%.

Unless the rating schedule specifies, the temporary ratings can range from 1 to 3 months. If a medical professional determines the Veteran needs additional time the Veteran may get file to get extensions up to a total of 6 months. Veterans who may require further extensions can get up to another 6 months if approved by the Veterans Service Center Manager.

* * *

<!-- Chunk 971/1206 | Heading: Convalescent Rating (Temporary 100% Rating) (38 CFR 4.30) | Words: 100 -->

---

### Eligibility

The surgery or procedure **MUST** be done on something that is _service-connected_ **AND**

- Surgery requires at least 1 month of convalescence;

- Surgery with severe postoperative residuals such as incompletely healed surgical wounds, stumps of recent amputations, therapeutic immobilization of one major joint or more, application of a body cast, the necessity for house confinement, or the necessity for continued use of a wheelchair or crutches (regular weight-bearing prohibited); **OR**

- Immobilization by cast, without surgery, of one major joint or more.

After the convalescent period end the Veteran's disability _may_ be [Reevaluated](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/cnp)  **UNLESS**, the schedule dictates a minimum rating the Veteran.

NOTES:

- Depending upon the Veteran's other ratings they may become eligible for [SMC S](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/smc#s)  during their period of convalescence.

- If the rating schedule specifies a Veteran will get say 6, 12, etc. months of temporary 100% rate, the Veteran will get an additional month of 100%. So the Veteran will in effect have 7, 13, etc. months of temporary 100%.

- If the Veteran retroactively becomes service-connected for something that made them eligible for a convalescent rating, they can file to get back pay - **SO LONG AS** the effective day is _before or during_ the Veteran's convalescent time period.

- If the Veteran needs an extension of their temp 100% due to their condition taking longer to recover, the Veteran can request an extension of up to 3 months by providing the VA medical evidence from their doctor demonstrating the need.

In order for the VA to grant the temporary 100% the medical evidence **MUST** show:

- The condition(s) which were the cause of the convalescence; and

- The length of the convalescence.

Medical evidence **MUST** show (when related to surgery):

- Date of admission;

- Date of discharge;

- Date of surgery;

- The length of the convalescence (if not dictated by the rating schedule); **AND**

- Procedure performed.

- If the procedure is noted for a non-service-connected condition then the VA may get a medical opinion to determine if the non-service-connected condition is a progression of a service-connected condition.

## **Amputation Rule (38 CFR 4.68)**

A Veteran **CANNOT** get a [Combined VA rating](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vamath)  higher for _musculoskeletal_ conditions for a limb than if it was amputated. In the rare cases in which the amputation rule is applied, the conditions that â€˜spill overâ€™ the maximum combined evaluation will be disabled and will **NOT** be applied to your combined disability evaluation!

For example:

- If a Veteran had their right dominant arm amputated above the elbow they would be awarded a rating of 80%.

- A Veteran who had no amputation could **NOT** have a combined VA rating higher than 80% for musculoskeletal conditions that involve their dominant [Elbow/forearm](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/elbowforearm)  [Wrist](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/wrist)  and/or [Hand](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/hand)

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- The amputation rule does **NOT** apply to evaluations of peripheral nerve disabilities of the extremities including, but not limited to: diabetic neuropathy, radiculopathy/sciatica due to a spinal disorder, or peripheral nerve injuries of non-musculoskeletal cause.

- The amputation rule does **NOT** apply to bilateral evaluations assigned under single DCs found in 38 CFR 4.71a, such as those assigned for bilateral foot disabilities, **EXCEPT** when being compared to a bilateral amputation of the same extremities.

## **Pyramiding Rule (38 CFR 4.14)**

The same disability/symptom **CANNOT** be rated twice.

An example would be a Veteran diagnosed with 2 ankle conditions that result in reduced range of motion. The Veteran could **NOT** get 2 separate ratings for each diagnosed condition based on the limitation of motion.

### Common Pyramiding Errors

Newer raters are known to sometimes improperly rate disabilities. As such, sometimes they will rate something separately that they shouldn't. The following are common pyramiding errors. If you have active ratings for any of the following two disabilities. You should contact a VSO **BEFORE** you file any new claims or increases, as the VA may identify the error(s) and fix them - which could result in you ending up with a lower rating than when you started!

- [Sleep apnea](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/airsystem#6847)  & [Asthma](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/airsystem#6602)

- [Median nerve](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/upnerves#8515)  & [Ulnar nerve](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/upnerves#8516)  (same arm)

- [PTSD](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/mental#9411)  & [TBI](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/cns#8045)

\*Unless the examiner _can_ differentiate the symptoms of both; then the rater needs to give the Veteran a separate rating for each.

## **Zero Percent Evaluations (38 CFR 4.31)**

In the event the rating schedule does not provide a 0% evaluation, an evaluation of 0% **CAN** still be given if the requirements for a compensable evaluation (over 0%) are not met.

Meaning, just because the schedule shows evaluations starting at say 10% - does **NOT** mean the minimum evaluation for service-connection is set at 10%!

## **Time Based Protections**

Veterans who have held their ratings for the following number of _continuous_ years have the following legal protections. However, if there was fraud involved then there are **NO** protections given! Errors on the part of the VA are **NOT** fraud.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- The date of time based protections start from the effective date of the grant, **NOT** the date of the rating decision!

* * *

<!-- Chunk 978/1206 | Heading: Time Based Protections | Words: 71 -->

### 5 Years - Reductions (38 CFR 3.344)

A Veteran's rating _generally_ cannot be reduced based upon a single [C&P exam](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/cnp)  that shows the Veteran's disability has improved. This is because **CONTINUOUS** improvement **MUST** be shown when the evaluation has been held for at least 5 _continuous_ years.

In **MOST** cases it will take another exam showing the condition is still improved before the Veteran **WILL** receive a [Proposal for reduction](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/reduction)  (if the reduction reduces your [Combined](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vamath)  evaluation; otherwise the condition will be reduced without notice).

Practical example to be reduced based on **ONE EXAM**:

- The condition is rated on lab results like [Kidney](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/gensystem)  or [Lung function](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/airsystem)  and the VA _happens_ to have lab results that show improvementâ€¦ whelp if _you filed an increase_ for that condition for some reason - you should **EXPECT** a reduction/proposal based if the VA does another lab test because of your claim and it confirms the improvement!

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- This protection does **NOT** reset after 5 years! Meaning if you had an exam showing improvement on year 6 and then another exam shows improvement at year 16, the VA **CAN** still come for blood!

- Ratings for diseases subject to temporary or episodic improvement, e.g., [Manic depressive](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/mental#9433)  or [Other psychotic reaction](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/mental#9411)  [Epilepsy](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/cns#seizure)  [Psychoneurotic reaction](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/mental#9400)  [Arteriosclerotic heart disease](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/heart#7005)  [Bronchial asthma](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/airsystem#6602)  [Gastric or duodenal ulcer](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/digsystem#7304)  many [Skin diseases](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/skin)  etc., will **NOT** be reduced based off of **ONE** examination showing improvement ( **EXCEPT** when all the evidence of record clearly shows that sustained improvement has been shown).

- Conditions granted temporary 100% are **NOT** protected by this regulation!

- Ratings for conditions which become comparatively symptom free (findings absent) after prolonged rest, e.g. residuals of [Phlebitis](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/bloodtubes#7121)  arteriosclerotic heart disease, etc., will **NOT** be reduced on examinations reflecting the improvement is _due_ to _bed rest_.

- **RATER COMMENT**: Yeahâ€¦ soâ€¦ if you _did not_ claim an increase for something unrelated to your claim and there is evidence of improvement - We ainâ€™t gonna go out of our ways to reduce you for that unclaimed/unrelated condition.

### 10 Years - Service-Connection (38 CFR 3.957)

A Veteran's service-connection for a disability **CANNOT** be severed, barring fraud or if it is clearly shown from military records that the Veteran did not have the required service or character of discharge.

NOTES AT 10 YEARS:

- The Veteran's erroneously service-connected condition is eligible for increases, if an increase is warranted.

- If the Veteran's erroneously service-connected condition causes other disabilities, they can be service-connected on a secondary basis.

**_SPECIAL NOTES:_**

- In the event the VA clearly and erroneously grants service-connection for a disability involving a specific location (left vs. right and/or upper vs. lower); the VA **CAN** reassign the location of the grant, even after 10 years. In the event such change results in a reduced evaluation, VA **MUST** provide due process and [Propose](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/proposed)  the change.

- Periods during which a Veteran is returned to Active Duty do **NOT** count for the purposes of calculating this protection!

### 20 Years - Total Protection (38 CFR 3.951)

A Veteran's entitlement to a benefit/rating **CANNOT** be severed/reduced, barring fraud!

**_SPECIAL NOTES:_**

- In the event the VA clearly and erroneously grants service-connection for a disability involving a specific location (left vs. right and/or upper vs. lower); the VA **CAN** reassign the location of the grant, even after 20 years. In the event such change results in a reduced evaluation, VA **MUST** provide due process and propose the change.

- Periods during which a Veteran is returned to Active Duty do **NOT** count for the purposes of calculating this protection!

- The pausing of [SMC](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/smc)  (based on need for aid and attendance) **IS** allowed when hospitalized at government expense!

### Example Involving Increase

| Condition | Rating % | Date | 5 years (Y/N) | 10 Years (Y/N) | 20 years (Y/N) | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Condition A | 10% | 1/2000 | N | N | N | Initial rating. |
| Condition A | 10% | 1/2005 | Y | N | N | 5 years later. |
| Condition A | 30% | 1/2010 | N\* | Y\* | N | Increased to 30%. |
| Condition A | 30% | 1/2015 | Y | Y | N | 30% has been held for 5 years. |
| Condition A | 30% | 1/2020 | Y | Y | N\*\* | 20 years have passed since initial rating. |
| Condition A | 30% | 1/2030 | Y | Y | Y | 30% rating has been held for 20 years total. |

\*Condition A has been held for 10 years, no matter the rating percentage. However, the 5 year protection **ONLY** applies to the 10% rating and **NOT** the newly increased rating of 30%.

\*\*Only the 10% rating has the 20 year protection, as it has been held for 20 years.

### Amputation

In the event that a Veteran has a non-service-connected **OR** service-connected amputation that removes something that was service-connected, the Veteran's rating will continue in force and **NOT** be reduced or removed.

* * *

<!-- Chunk 983/1206 | Heading: Amputation | Words: 36 -->

### Changes in the Schedule

In the event that the rating schedule changes, the Veteran will be grandfathered under the older schedule.

Do know that in the event it is found that the Veteran has improved under their grandfathered schedule **AND** the new schedule, the Veteran will then have their evaluation reduced/ [Proposed to be reduced](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/reduction)  and rated per the current rating schedule (assuming they do **NOT** have a protected evaluation).

If over the life of a claim the schedule changes, the Veteran's condition will be evaluated based upon the schedule in force on the [Effective date](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/edate)  of the grant. **IF** the new schedule is better then a [Stag](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/edate#staged)  [ed](https://www.reddit.com/r/VeteranBenefits/wiki/edate/#wiki_staged_effective_dates)  evaluation will be given, from the date of the schedule change.

<!-- Chunk 984/1206 | Heading: Changes in the Schedule | Words: 124 -->

---

### Aged over 55

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- This is a common misconception as it is **NOT** actually a form of rating protection!

What being aged over 55 or more _does_ do is:

- The VA will not establish regularly scheduled reexaminations - in most cases. Effectively, making the condition static.

- However, some conditions do [Require](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mandatory)  regularly scheduled reexaminations such as:

- Cancers; and

- Infectious diseases such as [Tuberculous](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/infect#6730)

So, if the Veteran decides to file a claim on a [Secondary basis](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/claimtype#secondary)  The VA _could possibly_ reevaluate the primary condition, and if appropriate - reduce the rating of the primary condition!

## **Incarcerated and Fugitive Felon Veterans**

Veterans who are incarcerated in a Federal, State or local penal institution in **excess of 60 days** for conviction of a **FELONY** _or_ are a fugitive felon will have their disability compensation reduced/stopped.

* * *

<!-- Chunk 986/1206 | Heading: Incarcerated and Fugitive Felon Veterans | Words: 42 -->

### Reduced Pay

Incarcerated Veterans have their pay reduced!

- Rated 20% or higher:

- Veteran will be paid at the 10% rate.
- Rated 10%, paid at 10%, or getting **ONLY** [Special Monthly Compensations (SMC) K](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/smc)

- Veteran will be paid **HALF** the rate of 10%.
- [VA Pension](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/pension)  (reduction may be due to either a felony conviction **_OR_** _misdemeanor)_:

- No pay at all.
- [Clothing allowance](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/clothes)

- If the institution provides clothing _without_ cost:

- Will have their clothing allowance reduced by X/365 for each day they are incarcerated - starting from the 61st day.

Fugitive Felons will have **ALL BENEFITS STOPPED**!

NOTE:

- Any SMCs will **NOT** be paid to the Veteran.

### Apportionment

If the Veteran's spouse/dependents rely on the Veteran's disability compensation, they may file to have all or part of the money that was reduced from the Veteran's compensation paid to themselves. This claim will be based upon a demonstrated need.

To file for apportionment [_VA Form 21-0788_](http://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-21-0788-ARE.pdf)  must be completed, signed by either the Veteran _or_ their dependent(s), and submitted to the VA _._

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- In the event the Veteran becomes a fugitive felon apportionment **WILL BE DISCONTINUED**!

- If the Veteran's conviction is overturned on appeal, the Veteran's disability pay _minus_ any apportioned money will be returned to the Veteran!

## **Frequently** **Asked Questions**

- #### What happens when the schedule changes?

For existing evaluations:

- The Veteran will be grandfathered under the older schedule and nothing will _automatically_ happen.

- If the new schedule just so happens to be better, the Veteran would need to file for an increase.
- If the Veteran files for an increase, they will be evaluated based upon the **NEW** schedule.

- In the event it is found that the Veteran has improved under both the new **AND** the grandfathered schedule, the Veteran will then have their rating reduced and rated per the current rating schedule (if their evaluation is not [Protected](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/#protection)

For ongoing claims/appeals during a new schedule becoming active:

- The VA will look at both schedules and will use the most favorable one for the Veteran.

- Do know that if the new schedule is used, the effective date can be **NO** earlier than the day the new schedule became active.

- #### Do I Need to Seek Treatment to Maintain My Ratings?

- No, a Veteran does not need to seek treatment through the VA or otherwise to maintain their ratings. (Some Veterans get confused about this, because Social Security does have this requirement.)

- #### Can My Disability Ratings be Lowered if my Disabilities Improve Due to Medications, other Treatments, or Surgeries?

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- In **MOST** cases, unless you file a new claim for increase, the VA will **NOT** just come looking at your previously rated conditions!

**CONTINUOUS Medication Usage:**

- If the schedule specifically mentions medication usage - the Veteran will be rated as stated. This generally results in the Veteran getting a higher rating.

- If the schedule does **NOT** mention medication usage - so long as the Veteran continues to take their medication they should **NOT** be reduced! [(Jones V. Shinseki (2012))](https://efiling.uscourts.cavc.gov/cmecf/servlet/TransportRoom?servlet=ShowDoc&dls_id=01202200801&caseId=70758&dktType=dktPublic)

**Non-Continuous Medication Usage:**

- The Veteran will be rated upon where their symptoms settle at.

**Other Treatments/Surgeries**

- Once treatment ends, the Veteran will be rated\* upon where their symptoms settle at.

- If after surgery you qualify for a [Convalescent rating](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/30)  of temporary 100%, the Veteran will be [Reevaluated](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/cnp)  (unless the schedules lists a minimum evaluation).

\*If and when the Veteran has a reevaluation.

Hello and welcome both currently serving Servicemembers and Veterans. This page is about helping you prepare and submit a claim for disability compensation. Alternatively, you can seek out a [Veterans Service Officer (VSO)](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vso)  to assist you with submitting a claim.

- If you just want a quick and dirty step-by-step guide click [HERE](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/dirty)

## **VA Disability**

VA disability is a monthly tax-free monetary benefit that ranges from over $100 to over **$10,000** in the case of [Special Monthly Compensation](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/smc)

* * *

<!-- Chunk 994/1206 | Heading: VA Disability | Words: 29 -->

---

## **Eligibility**

Basic eligibility requirements for VA disability are:

- Have a _chronic disability_ that was the result of your military service\*, a preexisting condition was made worse by your military service, _or_ was the result of an already service connected disability; and

- Your character of discharge was Honorable (this includes General, Under Honorable)\*\*; and

- You served on Active Duty (AD), Active Duty for training (ADT), or Inactive Duty Training (IADT).

\*This **DOES** include those who served in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the Public Health Service (PHS), and Academy Cadets.

\*\*Even if your character of discharge was not Honorable, you _may_ still be eligible.

- For more information click [HERE](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/upgrade)

<!-- Chunk 995/1206 | Heading: Eligibility | Words: 115 -->

---

## **Active Duty Servicemembers**

[Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD)](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/bdd)  \- If you have 90-180 days before separation you may file a BDD. Ideally, this will allow you to get a claims decision the day after you separate.

If you have less than 90 days before separation you can and should still file a claim!

To file a claim yourself, you can go to [VA.gov](https://www.va.gov/disability/how-to-file-claim/)

For those undergoing a Medboard click [HERE](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/medboard)

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- **BEFORE** you separate from service obtain a copy of your military medical records!

- If you were ever seen for things outside of a military medical/troop center, etc. Those records will **NOT** be apart of your military medical records by default! You must coordinate with your base medical. You either need to hand deliver those records or have the place(s) you saw off base fax them to your base medical, after you have signed the applicable releases. Do know, that some offices will charge patients to obtain a copy of their records, but if they fax them to base medical there _should_ be no charge.

- If you've been neglecting your health, start seeking treatment for your disabilities. Make appointments **NOW**! Ideally you will have a diagnosis _before_ you separate.

- Write down **EVERY ISSUE** you have **EVER HAD** on your [DD 2807-1](https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/forms/dd/dd2807-1.pdf)  **Even if** you have been unable to be formally seen for some issues.

- You will **NOT** be paid mileage for your visits to C&P exams (Those who have separated **WILL** be paid mileage to attend C&P exams).

- If you need health care while on terminal leave you **CAN** use your [TRICARE](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/tricare)  health insurance.

<!-- Chunk 996/1206 | Heading: Active Duty Servicemembers | Words: 275 -->

---

## **National Guard/Reserves**

If you incur or aggravate an injury, illness, or disease while in the line of duty (performing ADT, IADT, drill weekend, or any other training while on orders), you could be eligible for disability compensation. This includes when traveling directly to or from your place of duty.

Please have your unit issue a Line of Duty (LOD) determination (or a Notice of Eligibility \[NOE\] if you're in the U.S. Coast Guard Reserve), in order to properly file a disability claim for those disabilities.

If you do not obtain a LOD/NOE you _will_ need to rely on [(Buddy letters/VA Form 21-10210)](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/buddy)  or [Personal statements](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/personal)

Alternatively, having pre and post-deployment physicals will also serve as excellent evidence - assuming of course you were honest and did not withhold information when you had them done.

## **Intent to File**

The first step in filing a claim is doing an Intent to File.

An _Intent to File_ is very important because it preserves your effective date. Your effective date is critical because it is used to determine the date the Veteran gets paid from!

NOTES:

- If you are recently separated Veteran you will have a de-facto intent to file opened for you the day _after_ you separate.

- If the recently separated Veteran files an intent to file **BEFORE** their one year separation anniversary they can be given up to an additional year to file their claim **AND** still get back pay to the day after they separate.

* * *

<!-- Chunk 998/1206 | Heading: Intent to File | Words: 116 -->

---

### Starting an Intent to File

There are several ways to submit an Intent to File to the VA:

- Online

- At [VA.gov](https://www.va.gov/disability/how-to-file-claim/)  (just start the online form).
- Using a [Veterans Service Officer (VSO)](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vso)

- To find a VSO near you. Click [Here](https://www.va.gov/ogc/apps/accreditation/index.asp)
- Phone

- Call 1-800-827-1000 and tell them you would like to initiate an intent to file.
- In person. Complete [VA-Form 21-0966](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/vba-21-0966-are.pdf)  and submit it to your nearest [VA Regional Office](https://www.va.gov/find-locations/?facilityType=benefits)

- Fax

- 844-531-7818
- By mail

- Submit [VA-Form 21-0966](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/vba-21-0966-are.pdf)  to:

> ```
>  Department of Veterans Affairs
>  Claims Intake Center
>  PO Box 4444
>  Janesville, WI 53547-4444
> ```

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- The VA will **NOT** go by the postmark! The VA will go off the date the intent to file is initially processed by the VA evidence intake center.

- Intent to files are good for **ONE YEAR**. Take this time to gather all your evidence to make your claim as strong as possible.

- Intent to files are good for **ONE** use only. **HOWEVER**, a single claim _can_ be used to file for multiple conditions. Further, if you file multiple claims/ [Appeals](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals)  on the _same day_, then **ALL** will fall under the same intent to file!

## **BEFORE Filing a Claim for a New Disability**

There are several important things you need to have in place **BEFORE** you file.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

Do **NOT** make a new claim for a condition when:

- You have been previously denied\* for it **OR** you want to claim a similar\*\* condition

If you do then your claim **WILL** be kicked back and you will be sent a letter saying you need to appeal.

So please save yourself the trouble and submit an appropriate [Appeal](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals)

\*Yes, no matter how soon _or_ long ago it was!

\*\*If you were denied for a lower back pain do **NOT** put in a new claim for back strain, lower spine stenosis, etc. However, [_PTSD_](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/mental#9411)  **IS** an exception. So if you previously claimed depression/anxiety and were denied you **CAN** put a new claim in for PTSD and vice versa.

* * *

<!-- Chunk 1000/1206 | Heading: BEFORE Filing a Claim for a New Disability | Words: 146 -->

---

### **BARE MINIMUM** You Need **BEFORE** You File a Claim:

If your claim does **NOT** have **ALL** three of the following parts do **NOT** file a claim. If you do, you will be denied without even being sent to a [Compensation & Pension Exam (C&P)](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/cnp)

| Part | Element |
| --- | --- |
| 1. | Statement of symptoms (how the condition affects you) **OR** current diagnosis. |
| 2. | An in-service event (documented or supported by lay statement(s) condition started in service), or service-connected disability that caused or worsened your disability. |
| 3. | A layman would think that 1 and 2 are related (nexus). |

- For more information on methods of service-connection click [Here](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/serviceconnection)

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- VHA and contract examiners **CANNOT** order hospitalization or surgical evaluation, such as colonoscopy or laparoscopy, and therefore **CANNOT** establish diagnoses for conditions that would require such workup. _However_, examiners may still conduct an examination on a claim if a required test needed to inform a medical assessment was previously done and is a matter of record.

- Common conditions that this restriction applies to include:

- [Endometriosis](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/femalesystem#7629)

- [Prostate Cancer](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/gensystem#7528)  (requires a biopsy to diagnosis for VBA purposes)
- [Veterans](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/personal)  and their [Buddies](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/buddy)  **CAN** provide lay statement(s) thatÂ the disability occurred from an in-service event, injury, or disease, the statement(s). VA **MUST** consider these statements so long as they are consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of the Veteranâ€™s military service ( [Parachutists](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/skill-badge)  having [Joint issues](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/msindex)  [Cannon crewmember](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/loud)  having [Hearing issues](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/ears#6100)  etc.).

- VA **CANNOT** determine that lay evidence lacks credibility _merely because_ it is unaccompanied by contemporaneous medical evidence! ( [M21-1 IV.i.1.B.1.c](https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018/content/554400000180495/M21-1-Part-IV-Subpart-i-Chapter-1-Section-B-Evidentiary-Standards-for-Finding-an-Examination-or-Opinion-Necessary)
- If you are claiming something as [Secondary](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/claimtype#secondary)  you should explain in a [Statement](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/personal)  how the conditions are related:

- If your [Ankle](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/ankle)  condition caused an altered gait so you walk wonky and you think it caused your [Knee](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/kneeleg)  issue due to how you walk now - **STATE IT**!

- If you think your [GERD](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/digsystem#7206)  is [Due to medications](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/tertiary)  you take that treat your [Back](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/spine)  pain - **STATE IT**!

- If you think your [Sleep apnea](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/airsystem#6847)  is due to medications used to treat a service-connected condition by way of those medications causing [Obesity](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/tertiary)  \- **STATE IT**!
- For those who are still **Active Duty** _OR are_ **within one year of leaving service**, just having number 1 will work (in order to get an examination).

- You **CANNOT** purely claim exposure to something. This includes [Asbestos](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/toxic)  [Agent Orange](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/agentorange)  [Burn pits](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/burnpits)  etc.

- You **MUST** claim the condition(s) you think the exposure caused! Just be sure to state in the claim what the exposure(s) were.
- Having non-presumptive [Toxic exposures](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/toxic)  **CAN** meet element 2 for conditions that are **NOT** [Mental](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)  or [Musculoskeletal](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/msindex)

- Having held **ANY** [MOS](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/loud)  meets element 2 for [Hearing loss](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/ears#6100)  [Tinnitus](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/ears#6260)

- Your claim **MUST** be specific regarding which limbs or joints are affected! You **CANNOT** just claim "Arthritis" or "Knee pain" you **MUST** state which joints are affected _as well as_ which side of the body IE right, left, or both!

- Certain groups of eligible Veterans (which **INCLUDES** recently separated Veterans) may be entitled to presumptive service-connection for certain disabilities. (Assuming certain conditions are met.)

| 2. | An in-service event, [Exposure, or service-connected disability that caused or worsened your disability.](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/toxic)  |
| 3. | A [Medical opinion connecting 1 and 2 together, also known as a nexus statement.](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/imo)  |

\*There are two exceptions to this requirement:

1. Undiagnosable [Gulf War medically unexplained chronic multi-symptom illness (MUCMI)](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/gulfill)  and

2. Undiagnosed chronic _physical_ conditions that cause functional impairment of earning ability.

- This is a fairly rare basis to grant as most examiners are _not_ going to provide a favorable medical opinion for it. So when it is granted, it is usually in-part because the claim was received within a year of separation/BDD claim.

NOTES:

- You do **NOT** need all three of those elements when you file your claim, your claims examiner _can_ help you. Especially element 3, as your C&P examiner can opine service connection. However it is **STRONGLY** recommended that you do have at least have elements 1 and 2 **BEFORE** you file, to increase the chances of getting service-connection.

- There are certain conditions that Veterans often don't think they can claim but should be aware of.

## **Obtaining/Types of Evidence**

The Veteran does **NOT** need to gather all evidence themselves - the VA has a [_Duty to Assist_](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/dta)  If the Veteran is unable to get their own _Service Treatment Records_ or _Private Medical Records_ the VA **WILL** request them for you. However, for the VA to get private medical records and/or [Vet Center](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vetcenter)  records you **MUST** provide them with a [VA Form 21-4142/21-4142a](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/vba-21-4142-are.pdf)  (records release).

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- **ALL** evidence obtained by the VBA _or_ sent to the VBA is scanned into a virtual [Claim file (cfile)](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/cfile)  Evidence is **NOT** linked to any one claim _or_ [Appeal](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals)  It is simply dumped into your cfile.

- Do **NOT** re-submit any evidence you have previously given the VBA! Your VA claim file is _permanent_ and evidence that is already of record **WILL** remain there. So submitting duplicate evidence _can_ make your claim harder to process (and makes VBA employees more likely to overlook something).

- If the private medical provider charges VBA for copies of your records the VBA **WILL** refuse to pay and will cancel the request. If this happens the VBA will let you know and tell you that it is now _your_ responsibility to provide these records.

- VBA **CAN** _generally_ access your VA Medical Records and Federal Medical Records (treatment at a military facility - even if seen **AFTER** separation)

- As mentioned above, VBA **CANNOT** access Vet Center Records without you completing a release.

- It is **NOT** necessary to submit your own [VA Medical Center Records](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/healthcare)  to the VBA since they can freely get those records.

- In the case of [Community Care Medical Records](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/commcare)  it is **_VERY_** inconsistent as to if they send records back to the VHA (so VBA can then get them). Therefore, it is a good idea to either give those records to the VBA yourself or give the VBA a release so they can request them.

### Service Treatment Records (STRs)/Military Medical Records

For Veterans who would like to obtain their own Service Treatment Records you have a couple of options available to you:

If the _how to obtain_ is an address/fax number it means you must complete an [SF 180](https://www.gsa.gov/reference/forms/request-pertaining-to-military-records)  and send it to that address/fax number.

Alternatively, if you have already filed a claim you can [Request](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/cfile)  your claim file for the records.

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- Again, you do **NOT** have to submit these records to the VA with your claim! As the VA will themselves make the request! And will likely get a response much faster than if you did it anyway.

- If your last unit of assignment was a National Guard or Reserve unit it is _possible_ they failed to forward your medical records to the archives or the VA. In such cases, you may want to contact them and request the records yourself from them. Assuming of course they didn't destroy them or completely lose them.

- Private medical records (treatment outside a military provider) is generally **NOT** included into your STRs unless **YOU** had them added.

### Miscellaneous Evidence

- Private Medical Records and Non-VA Hospital Reports that relate to your claimed illnesses or injuries, or that show your disability has gotten worse (you **MUST** provide them with a [VA Form 21-4142/21-4142a](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/vba-21-4142-are.pdf)  if you want VA to obtain them for you).

- Newspaper articles showing you were personally involved in an event or that an event occurred during a time you were in a location.

- [Buddy Statements](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/buddy)  youâ€™d like to provide from family members, friends, clergy members, law enforcement personnel, or those you served with that can tell the VA more about your claimed condition and how and when it happened, how it got worse, and how it currently effects you.

- [Supporting/Personal Statements](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/personal)  Basically, if you want to point things out in your records, to help ensure the rater does not miss anything, or if you want to add some context/detail to your evidence that may otherwise not be known.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

When filing for [PTSD](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)  the following form is _generally_ **REQUIRED**:

- Supporting Statements for Service-connection for PTSD [VA Form 21-0781](http://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-21-0781-ARE.pdf)

NOTES:

- The VBA **CAN** access your VHA medical records themselves, so it is **NOT** necessary to upload them as apart of your claim!

- **HOWEVER**, [Vet Center](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vetcenter)  notes (you **MUST** give the VA [Written permission](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/vba-21-4142-are.pdf)  to access these notes!)
- Maximum file size allowed for uploading documents online is 50MB.

## **Organizing Records**

Some of ya'll got records that are measured in inches/lbs instead of by pages! While it can be great to have a ton of evidence, it does increase the possibility of the VA missing something! This holds especially true for those of us whose records are primarily chicken-scratch doctor handwriting and/or crappy micro-phish images.

If you want to _help ensure_ the VA does **NOT** miss anything, go ahead and include a table of contents as the first page of your evidence - particularly if you have a beefy military/civilian medical file. If you cannot figure out how to do this, then you can separately upload a table of contents document.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- You do **NOT** need to submit full copies of your Service Treatment Records (STRs) or private medical records. You can just submit the pages that are relevant/support your claims.

## **Before Filing an Increase Claim**

Please review the [Rating schedule](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/ratingsindex)  to see if your current level of disability qualifies for an increase.

That said, the process of filing for an increase is similar to filing for service-connection.

You can file for it on the va.gov website and the VA will order new exam(s) to determine the current severity of your condition(s).

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- Filing for increases **DOES** open your entire file for review. Meaning, if there are errors in your file the VA is duty bound to correct them. This knife _does_ cut both ways! So it can help as well as hurt you. However, _most_ raters will not look outside of the condition(s) you file an increase for; Unless there is something blatantly wrong that stands out.

- You do **NOT** need to supply evidence that your condition has worsened!

## **Common Errors when Filing Claims**

If you decide to go in alone without a [VSO](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vso)  please be extra careful before you send in your claim!

Some common errors Veterans make are:

- Forgetting to sign something.

- Using the incorrect form.

- Using an expired form.

- Forgetting to write the correct dates or any dates at all.

- Submitting an appeal _before_ your claim has closed.

The VA will _attempt_ to honor this request, if reasonable/possible.

Likewise, if you would only like a tele-health appointment for say your mental health appointment, you can make that request as well.

- Online alternative

- Complete [VA-Form 21-526EZ](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-21-526EZ-ARE.pdf)  and submit it [HERE](https://eauth.va.gov/accessva/?cspSelectFor=quicksubmit)
- Fax

- 844-531-7818
- In person

- Complete [VA-Form 21-526EZ](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-21-526EZ-ARE.pdf)  and submit it to your nearest [VA Regional Office](https://www.va.gov/find-locations/?facilityType=benefits)

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- If you file a new claim while another claim is active, the VA **WILL** close the newly filed claim automatically! **DO NOT FEAR**! The VA **WILL** eventually combine your newly claimed issues with the older active claim.

- The VA will **NOT** go by the postmark! The VA will go off the date the claim is initially processed by the intake center! Sooo... if you snail mail your claim in and it is processed past the year of your intent to file... well you lost that year of potential back pay!

- The section pictured below (on the online claim) is **CRITICALLY IMPORTANT**! It is here where you will state how your condition is related to your military service or a service-connected condition!

## **After Submitting a Claim**

The next step in the claims process that involves the Veteran is the [Compensation & Pension Exam (C&P)](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/cnp)  Click the link to learn more about the C&P process.

Veterans can expect to be scheduled for a C&P exam shortly after they file their claim. However, there are cases in which a Veteran won't get one at all or it will take several months before one is scheduled.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- Make sure you keep your mailing address, email address, and phone number up-to-date with the VA. Failure to do so may result in you missing notice of an examination!

## **Frequently** **Asked Questions**

- #### How long will it take for my claim to finish?

- Claim completion time varies from a few weeks to over a year. This depends on several factors:

- The type of claim you filed.

- How many injuries or disabilities you claimed and how complex they are.

- How long it takes the VA to collect the evidence needed to decide your claim.

- The availability of examiners in your area for the type of examination(s) you require.
- To see what the current average time it takes to complete a claim click [HERE](https://www.benefits.va.gov/reports/mmwr_va_claims_online.asp)

- #### How do I check the status of my claim?

- You can check the status of your claim [HERE](https://www.va.gov/claim-or-appeal-status/)  However, we do **NOT** recommend you constantly check as your claim can and **WILL** go back and forth in the steps

- You can also check your status via the [VA Claim Tracking App](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/va-claim-tracker/onbanekcefgnibhlaiimeadkbdahjpoo)

- #### Can the VA work my claim during the weekend/holidays?

- Yes.

- #### What do I do while I wait?!

- Try and take up a hobby to fill up your time and head instead of constantly checking and worrying about your claim.

- #### I have evidence to submit in support of my claim but I don't want to mail/fax evidence!

- Not a question.... But you **CAN** submit evidence via the [Quick submit portal](https://eauth.va.gov/accessva/?cspSelectFor=quicksubmit)  online.

- #### The VA website/App is down!?

- It is not uncommon for the VA to do maintenance on the weekends.

- #### Can I use a lawyer or claims agent to help me file a new claim?

- Yes, accredited attorneys and claims agents can help you. However, since they **CANNOT** charge you a percentage of your back pay for new claims, they typically only become involved on appeals (after a claim has been denied).

- #### What should I do if I disagree with my claim's decision?

- If you disagree with your claim's decision (all or parts) you can [Appeal](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals)  the decision. You have up to one year to appeal the decision and still preserve the initial "intent to file" [Effective date](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/edate)  of the claim.

- #### Can I file for a secondary condition if the primary condition is not yet service-connected?

- Yes, so long as the primary condition is either filed within the same claim, is currently undecided in another claim, _or_ is currently undecided in an appeal.

- #### The CD I got from medical is password protected, I don't remember the password?

- Try the last four of your social security number and the first three letters of your first name in lowercase.

- #### If I file an new claim/increase, can the VA reduce my ratings?

- Yes, by filing a claim you invite the VA to review your file. If it is found that a [Clear and Unmistakable Error](https://www.reddit.com/r/VeteransBenefits/wiki/appeals/#wiki_clear_and_unmistakable_error_.28cue.29)  occurred and you were rated either too high or that service-connection was granted in error, the VA WILL start action to fix the error! Further, if exams show your condition(s) have improved, the VA _can_ start action to reduce you!

- Do know that the rater will stick to the path for the most part. Meaning, if you file for say your right knee, they are not gonna be poking around unrelated ratings like your mental health or shoulder.

- #### If I file a claim secondary to something, will the VA automatically reevaluate the primary condition?

- Not always. If you do not indicate in your claim or in any statements that the primary condition has worsened the VA **SHOULD** _not_ evaluate the primary condition. However, in practice this is not always followed.

- #### Do I need to resubmit evidence that I provided for a previous claim/appeal?

- No, evidence provided to the VA stays in your permanent file and can be freely accessed for use in new claims.

- #### If I was seen by a civilian doctor in-service are those records considered Service Treatment Records?

- Yes. Do know that TriCare may not have received all of those medical records so you should either supply those records to the VA or sign the [Release](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/vba-21-4142-are.pdf)  to allow the VA to obtain them for you.

- #### If an injury occurred while I was on leave can I get service-connection?

- So long as the injury was not the result of gross-misconduct, certainly!

- #### I just got granted/denied an increase claim, is there a set time I must wait before filing another increase claim?

- No, you can file right away.

- #### Can I file multiple claims/appeals at once?

- Yes, you can file multiple claims/separate appeals at the same time.

NOTES:

- If you file additional claims while a previous claim is still being processed the new claim **WILL BE** closed administratively and merged with the prior claim. This merging does **NOT** allow those later conditions to be considered received with the older claim - merely that they are processed together.

- You **CANNOT** file multiple appeals for the **_SAME_** _issue_ at the **SAME** time.

- #### If I have a claim and appeal(s) open at the same time can the VA rate them together?

- Generally speaking, the rater can rate them at the same time - assuming both are ready to be rated at the same time and that there is no [Jurisdictional](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/jurisdiction)  conflict.

- #### Will filing a new claim slow down any active appeals I have?

- No, each appeal is processed separately from all other claims/appeals.

- #### Will filing additional claims slow my current claim down?

- Maybe:

- If you are in line to get before a rater it will kick it out of line and back to [Step 2](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/stages)

- If you were in steps 3 or 4 then no real loss in terms of speed.

- #### My claim closed for NO REASON!?

This generally happens for 1 of 4 reasons:

1. You had an active claim already open. Va will merge the new with the old.

2. You filed an appeal on the wrong form (you were previously denied).

3. You do not have any period(s) of service the VA can consider as [Honorable for VA purposes](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/upgrade)

4. Va is big dumb and closed it in error thinking 2 applied.

Bonus 5th option: website just a buggy mess, give it a day or 2.

If you think it was closed in error consider making a [VERA appointment](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vera)  and ask them to look under the hood.

- #### Can I claim multiple theories of service-connection (direct, secondary, presumptive) at the same time?

- Yes! You are not expected to be a medical professional and know exactly what caused your issue. So there is no harm in presenting multiple theories to the VA at the same time.

- #### Can I claim something as secondary to multiple conditions at the same time?

- Yes.

If you do **NOT** agree with your claim's decision, you may file an appeal. Just like [Filing a claim](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vaclaim)  you _may_ use the assistance of a [VSO](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vso)  lawyer, or an accredited claims agent.

There are three initial different methods to appeal:

1. Higher-Level Review;

2. Supplemental claim; or

3. Board of Veteran Appeals (BVA).

If your appeal is denied again you **CAN** try another eligible option (see applicable notes).

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- If you want to keep your [Effective date](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/edate)  (your back pay) you **MUST** file an appeal within **one year** of your claim's decision date! Veterans who fail to do that can only get their original effective date and back pay if there is a [Clear and Unmistakable Error (CUE)](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals#cue)

- Lawyers and claims agents **CANNOT** charge more than **33.3%**\\* (excluding expenses\*\*) of the Veteran's back pay. Further, they can _only_ get paid if/when the Veteran wins their appeal. Again, VSOs are a resource that is free to the Veteran.

- **PICK A LANE**! You **CANNOT** file multiple appeals/methods for the _same issue_ at the same time ( _without_ first withdrawing the current appeal)!

- If you filed an appeal to BVA and are tired of waiting you **CANNOT** then file a supplemental claim while the BVA case is pending for the _same issues_.

- Likewise, you **CANNOT** file an HLR and supplemental claim for the same issue at the same time, etc.

- You **CAN** file an HLR for [Hearing loss](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/ears)  and a supplemental claim for a [Back](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/spine)  issue at the same time - since they are _different issues_.

- **EXCEPTION:**

- If you have an appeal in at a court above BVA you **_CAN_** then have a separate appeal open for the same issue (just canâ€™t go immediately back to the previous lower court).

\*The VA will only pay up to 20% automatically from the back pay. If the agreement is over 20% then, the Veteran will need to pay the difference to the lawyer themselves.

\*\*Expenses can be things like postage, travel costs, or printing supplies.

## **BEFORE You File an Appeal**

**_BEFORE_** you appeal your claim do so in an informed manner! Don't run back onto the battlefield without a plan!

Read your **Decision Letter**!

- Was _all_ the evidence you submitted listed under evidence considered?

- What were the favorable findings?

- What does it say your claim was missing?

- Did it say you missed an exam?

Your decision letter _should_ outline what you need to do in order to make a successful appeal!

- For information on understanding rating decisions click [HERE](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/ratingdecision)

<!-- Chunk 1028/1206 | Heading: BEFORE You File an Appeal | Words: 93 -->

### Getting a Copy of Your Decision Narrative

You can get a copy of your decision online [HERE](https://www.va.gov/track-claims/your-claim-letters)

_Alternatively, after_ 10 days have past since the claim closed, you can call the VA at 1-800-827-1000 and request them email your decision narrative to you.

\*This **CAN** be used to get old decision letters as well.

## **Denied Service-Connection**

If you were not granted [Service-connection](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/serviceconnection)  what was missing from your claim?

- Was it a current diagnosis;

- An in service event; and/or

- Did the examiner say that there was _a less likely than not_ chance that your disability was the result of your service or service-connected disability?

If you feel that the rater did not properly evaluate the evidence that was a part of your claim, an HLR may be appropriate.

Otherwise if you need to submit additional supporting information, a supplemental claim may be appropriate. Veterans who need help with the determination of service-connection may want to look into submitting an [Independent medical opinion (IMO)/Nexus letter](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/imo)  [Personal statement](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/personal)  or [Buddy statement(s)](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/buddy)  as appropriate.

If you were told you missed an exam then file a supplemental claim and state, "I am willing an able to attend exams at this time" on the appeal form.

---

## **Low Rating**

If you were granted service-connection (at least 0% evaluation) but were given an evaluation that was lower than what you expected, you can appeal this. Your decision letter _should_ detail what the criteria is for the next highest evaluation. It should also note if the rating you were awarded was the maximum. If it says you are the maximum... you should really leave it be...

If you feel that you meet the [Requirements](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/ratingSIndex)  for a higher rating then you should verify the information in the Examiner's [Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ)](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/dbq)  If the DBQ indicates you should have gotten a higher rating, an HLR may be appropriate. If the DBQ indicates otherwise then a supplemental claim (with medical evidence dated **BEFORE** the rater made their decision, would be more appropriate).

## **Higher-Level Review** [**(HLR 20-0996)**](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-20-0996-ARE.pdf)

An entirely new review of your claim by an experienced (more senior) rater; formally these are titled Decision Review Officers (DRO).

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- New evidence (evidence received **AFTER** the decision was made) **CANNOT** be considered in a Higher-Level Review!

- [Intent to files](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vaclaim#itf)  do **NOT** apply to HLRs!

- Unlike other raters DROs get the extra authority to issue a _differences of opinion_.

- Differences of opinions include weighing evidence differently which result in a favorable outcome for the Veteran. These differences of opinions are **NOT** errors made by the last rater, just a _difference of opinion_.

- Mere differences of opinions **CANNOT** result in a negative outcome for the Veteran!

- However, if the previous rater(s) made [Clear and Unmistakable Errors (CUEs)](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals#cue)  those errors **CAN** be corrected **EVEN** if negative (with appropriate [Due notice](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/proposed)

NOTES:

- The Veteran **CANNOT** file a HLR, back-to-back. **HOWEVER**, you **CAN** file a HLR into a supplemental, into another HLR, into a supplemental, etc.

- The Veteran **CANNOT** request an HLR after having a BVA denial.

- The Veteran **MUST** submit their HLR within a year of their claim's decision. Veterans are **NOT** allowed to request an HLR after this time frame.

| Question | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Should I choose this? | If you think the evidence the VA has is enough to make a positive decision. |
| What will happen? | A senior rater will reexamine your claim. |

* * *

<!-- Chunk 1034/1206 | Heading: Higher-Level Review [(HLR 20-0996)](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-20-0996-ARE.pdf) | Words: 252 -->

---

### Informal Conference

If you would like to plead your case to the person doing your appeal you may request an informal conference (Section IV of the form).

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- If the rater **CAN** make a **POSITIVE** decision based upon the evidence of record the rater **CAN** decide that an informal conference is unnecessary! So do not feel bad if one is **NOT** scheduled!

- You can **ONLY** talk about errors of fact _or_ law as it relates to your appeal during this call.

- This would include things such as, the VA missing or not considering evidence that was originally submitted with your claim.

- Ideally, you would have this planned out so you can point out specifically where evidence is: 'Evidence that I had an in-service event can be found on page x of my service treatment records'.
- Choosing to have an informal conference _may_ result in your appeal taking longer to process.

* * *

<!-- Chunk 1035/1206 | Heading: Informal Conference | Words: 160 -->

---

#### Alternative to Informal Conference

Instead of requesting an informal conference you may submit a [Personal statement](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/personal)  with your HLR.

Again, you can **ONLY** write about errors of fact _or_ law as it relates to your appeal. Remember, you **CANNOT** use this statement as a means to add new evidence to your appeal!

* * *

<!-- Chunk 1036/1206 | Heading: Alternative to Informal Conference | Words: 56 -->

---

### Submitting an HLR

There are several options to submit your HLR to the VA:

- Complete and Submit Online Form

- Click [HERE](https://www.va.gov/decision-reviews/higher-level-review/request-higher-level-review-form-20-0996/start)
- Submit Paper Form Online

- Click [HERE](https://eauth.va.gov/accessva/?cspSelectFor=quicksubmit)
- Via your VSO

- In-person

- Click [HERE](https://www.va.gov/find-locations/)  to locate your nearest Regional Office.
- Snail Mail

> ```
>  Department of Veterans Affairs
>  Claims Intake Center
>  PO Box 4444
>  Janesville, WI 53547-4444
> ```

**!!WARNING!!**

- The VA will **NOT** go by the postmark! The VA will go off the date the appeal is initially processed by the VA's intake center. As such, if your appeal is processed **AFTER** the one year deadline your appeal will be refused and you **WILL** lose your effective date (back pay)!

* * *

<!-- Chunk 1037/1206 | Heading: Submitting an HLR | Words: 127 -->

---

### Claim Accuracy Request (CAR) \[PILOT PROGRAM\]

```
May also be called claim accuracy review.
```

CAR is a quicker/priority lane version of an HLR, with the lofty goal of a decision within 30 days.

**ONLY** VSOs, accredited attorneys, and accredited agents may request a CAR for obvious errors of fact or law (Does _not_ have to be a [Clear and Unmistakable Error (CUE)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals#cue)  but that is the general idea behind it).

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- This request **MUST** be made within **30 DAYS** of the date of the notification letter for the rating decision!

- If the CAR does _not_ find a error occurred, another HLR for the issue **CANNOT** be filed back-to-back! A supplemental or BVA appeal _can_ be filed.

* * *

<!-- Chunk 1038/1206 | Heading: Claim Accuracy Request (CAR) \[PILOT PROGRAM\] | Words: 124 -->

---

### Flowchart of an HLR

By their design HLRs could be considered as starting in the Rating step of the [Stages of a claim](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/stages)  \- as they are simply a review of the existing evidence and do not allow consideration of new or gathering new evidence. Which is likely why the VA doesnâ€™t give insight into where an HLR is atâ€¦ since it is either waiting on a DRO or is in short order waiting on authorization.

If a de facto supplemental claim is opened then it will follow the normal stages of a claim.

* * *

<!-- Chunk 1039/1206 | Heading: Flowchart of an HLR | Words: 98 -->

---

### Deciding a HLR

If the senior rater is able to make an appropriate grant/denial based upon the existing evidence of record they will do so. However, if the senior rater finds a [Duty to Assist (DTA)](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/dta)  error they will make a rating decision and close the HLR; noting the DTA errors they found that need to be addressed.

These DTA errors will be addressed in a de facto supplemental claim, which is opened (at some point).

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- The DRO **CAN** find a DTA error, confirm and continue, and issue a difference of opinion on separate issues all within the same decision.

- This supplemental claim will **NOT** use any new [Intents to File](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vaclaim#intent)

- If the VA is able to grant then any intent to file associated with the prior claim/appeals **CAN** be used to assign an [Effective date](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/edate#itf)  \- just that the de facto supplemental will not itself use any unassociated intents hanging around in your file.
- This de facto supplemental claim **DOES** allow you to submit new and relevant evidence!

- This de facto supplemental claim _is_ decided by raters who are **NOT** DROs.

- These raters are **NOT** given the extra authority or power that DROs get!
- If the de facto supplemental claim decision results in another denial you **CAN** file a HLR on the decision!

## **Supplemental Claim** [**(20-0995)**](http://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-20-0995-ARE.pdf)

An opportunity to submit **NEW AND RELEVANT** evidence.

- New: The VA did not previously have/consider it.

- Relevant: Directly addresses the rationale for the denial.

- For example: If you were denied for having no diagnosis, you need to supply evidence of a diagnosis.

New and relevant evidence can take the form of:

- Being seen by your doctor for the claimed issue(s);

- New theory of service-connection (claiming your condition was caused by another service-connected disability);

- This _does_ include [Presumptive conditions](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/Presumptive)  be they old or recently passed presumptives;
- Exam willingness - if you were previously denied because you missed an exam, simply state that you are willing and able to attend new examinations;

- [Independent medical opinion (IMO)/Nexus letter](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/imo)

- [DBQ](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/dbq)

- [Personal statements](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/personal)  or

- [Buddy statements](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/buddy)

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- Remember you have **1 year** from the claim's decision to file an appeal (if you want to potentially keep your back pay). Which means 1 year to develop additional evidence for your claim. We recommend waiting until you have enough evidence to be successful before filing - your VSO or lawyer can advise you on this. Do not file appeals with insufficient evidence, this just gums up the system for you and other Veterans!

- Do know you **CAN** extend this window for by filing an [Intent to file](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vaclaim#intent)  The intent to file will give you a year (from the intent to file) to gather evidence. While allowing you to keep back pay.
- If the VA grants an increased rating based upon a supplemental claim, the [Effective date](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/edate)  does **NOT** automatically go back to the original claim!

- If **MEDICAL** evidence shows an increase is warranted that is dated **BEFORE/AFTER** you initiated your supplemental claim the effective date will typically be the date of the medical evidence showing an increase was warranted; this typically is the date of your [Examination](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/cnp)
- Do **NOT** file a supplemental claim for an evaluation after a year! Even if you have new evidence showing a higher evaluation was previously warranted! If you do, at best the effective date will be the date the supplemental was initiated or at **WORST** the date of the examination conducted **AFTER** your filed the supplemental! So in these cases, just file a increase claim!

NOTES:

- Veterans **CAN** file a supplemental claim **ANYTIME** after their denial. However, to _potentially_ get back pay from the start, they _must_ file within a year of the last decision.

- Veterans **CAN** submit a supplemental claim over and over again. _So long as_, there is new and relevant evidence being submitted _every time_.

- If you need the VA to get non-federal medical records or [Vet Center](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vetcenter)  records for you, then you will need to also submit a [VA Form 21-4142/21-4142a](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/vba-21-4142-are.pdf)

| Question | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Should I choose this? | If your appeal requires new evidence. |
| What will happen? | A decision will be made looking at the new and previous evidence. |

- "A reviewer is examining your new evidence".

Either of these statuses will remain till the claim is actually closed out.

## **Board Veterans' Appeals (BVA) AKA, Notice of Disagreement (NOD), AKA** [**10182**](https://www.va.gov/vaforms/va/pdf/VA10182.pdf)

Review by a Veterans Law Judge at the Board of Veteransâ€™ Appeals. These judges are **NOT** bound by VA Central Office policy decisions and **CAN** issue grants that raters are unable to do! So you will see decisions which are inconsistent or directly contradict VA policies being made by these judges.

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- Due to the time this takes to complete a BVA appeal ( **YEARS**) it is commonly only chosen once the other appeal options (Supplemental Claim and/or Higher Level Review) have been exhausted.

- The Veteran can **MUST** submit their appeal to the BVA within a year of their claim's decision. Veterans are **NOT** allowed to request a BVA after this time frame.

- Veterans are **NOT** allowed to request a BVA appeal _after_ receiving a BVA decision _for the same claimed item - back to back_.

There are three lanes (appeal dockets) in which the Veteran can choose when going through the BVA:

1. Direct Review

2. Evidence Submission

3. Hearing

---

### 1\. Direct Review

In essence an HLR. However, instead of a senior rater a judge reviews your claim. Due to there be far fewer judges than senior raters, this **WILL** take much longer than an HLR.

NOTE:

- You **CANNOT** submit new evidence.

* * *

<!-- Chunk 1045/1206 | Heading: 1\. Direct Review | Words: 47 -->

---

### 2\. Evidence Submission

In essence a supplemental claim. However instead of a rater a judge reviews your claim. Due to there be far fewer judges than raters, this **WILL** take much longer than an supplemental claim.

NOTE:

- You **CAN** submit new evidence. If you do not submit all the evidence with your claim you have **90 days** from the day your NOD is received.

* * *

<!-- Chunk 1046/1206 | Heading: 2\. Evidence Submission | Words: 69 -->

---

### 3\. Hearing

Your chance to plead your case before a judge by videoconference (or in-person in DC). After your hearing you will have 90 days to submit any new evidence. The Judge will make a decision considering the hearing and the evidence of record.

### Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC)

These judges can really do whatever they want in terms of interpreting the laws and regulations that bind the VBA. As such, decisions made by the CAVC create case law that _does_ change how the VBA operates!

Veterans have **120 days** after their BVA decision in which to have their appeal in the hands of the CAVC. This appeal **MUST** be made to the [CAVC itself](https://www.uscourts.cavc.gov/appeal.php)  and **NOT** the VA!

While the Veteran is allowed to represent themselves it is **STRONGLY** recommended that they seek out a lawyer at this stage!

## **Accredited Agents and Attorneys**

For Veterans who have a claim that has a certain legal angle or issue(s). Obtaining the services of an accredited agent or attorney may be beneficial.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- _Most_ appeals do **NOT** require legal assistance!

In order for an accredited agent or attorney to represent the Veteran. Both parties must sign a [VA Form 21-22a](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/vba-21-22a-are.pdf)

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- Pay attention to **Block 23**! If you are only interested in having representation for a specific claim you **MUST** write this interest in this block! Failure to do so allows them to file additional appeals without additional consent!

* * *

<!-- Chunk 1054/1206 | Heading: Accredited Agents and Attorneys | Words: 105 -->

### Fees (Fee Agreement)

By [Law](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/38/14.636)  the Veteran **CANNOT** be charged more than **33.3%** of any _back pay_ the Veteran receives from the VA.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- If the Veteran feels their agent/attorney did not earn their fee. Due to perceptions of poor communication with the Veteran, lack of action, etc. The Veteran **CAN** file a motion to have the fee reduced **OR** removed.

For more information on the process click [HERE](https://www.va.gov/ogc/docs/accred/howtochallengeafee.pdf)

<!-- Chunk 1055/1206 | Heading: Fees (Fee Agreement) | Words: 75 -->

---

### Removing Representation

It is possible to remove an accredited agent or an attorney from representing you at **ANY** time. This can be done by:

- Submitting a [Personal statement](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/personal)  saying you want to remove/revoke access to your specific representative;

- Calling the VA at 1-800-698-2411 and let them know â€œPlease remove \[Name of representative\] as my representative immediately.â€; _or_

- Assigning someone new as your representative be it another attorney, claim agent, or [VSO](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vso)

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- Removing their representation does **NOT VOID** the fee agreement (you likely signed)! If it did there would be a lot of slick Veterans trying to screw over their representative.

- Again, if you later win your appeal and you feel they did not earn their fee you **CAN** still fight it (as mentioned previously).

## **Clear and Unmistakable Error (CUE)**

Oh no, it has been over a year but I still want all my back pay! If your claim has a CUE it is possible to still get that back pay.

CUEs are **EXTREMELY** fact specific as such it is **STRONGLY** advised that the Veteran seek out an experienced VSO or lawyer to help them! If the Veteran makes an error in their filing the VA does **NOT** have a duty to assist them in the cases of CUEs. As such the CUE may be wasted.

CUEs are **NOT** a matter of a difference in opinion. CUEs involve errors that **CANNOT** be debated and must be such, that a _reasonable person_ would agree that the VA messed up.

CUEs must be based upon evidence that was available to the VA at the time the decision was made. The Veteran **CANNOT** assert that later evidence or evidence that was not given to the VA proved that the Veteran should have been given a favorable decision!

Further, CUEs **MUST** be considered in the realm of what the laws/regulations/policies were _at the time they were decided_. Veterans **CANNOT** try to apply current laws/regulations/policies to decisions that were made prior to them!

In order to invoke a CUE the Veteran **MUST** state a CUE has occurred _AND_ **MUST** specify the factual or legal error(s) at issue.

**Seriously, get help!**

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- You only get **_ONE_** shot at a CUE per issue. That's it! If you pick something that isn't a CUE and you look back and 'gosh, oh shoot this other thing is the CUE!' That is it. Thanks for playing!

- [Duty to Assist](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/dta)  errors can **NEVER** be the basis of a CUE; as only evidence of record at the time of the prior decision can be considered.

- CUEs are a knife that **CAN** cut both ways! Meaning these errors getting corrected **CAN** end up hurting or helping you. It is common for raters to find multiple additional CUEs when you declare a CUE; since a rater who already made at least 1 CUE is generally just gonna mess everything else up!

- CUEs **CANNOT** sever service-connection for conditions that have been service-connected for at least 10 years (barring findings of the grant itself having no legal basis or fraud).

- If [Secondary](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/claimtype#secondary)  service-connection is granted for a condition **AND** the condition it is secondary to is severed, then the VA will then propose to sever the secondary conditions - assuming there are no other routes to grant them service-connection.
- CUEs **CANNOT** reduce an evaluation held for at least 20 years.
- Forgotten claims (conditions not rated) and missed issues (conditions that should have been inferred or ancillary benefits that were overlooked) are **NOT** CUEs! While they are certainly administrative errors, they are _not_ CUEs because the VA has not erred in making a decision one way or the other.

- Generally forgotten and missed issues/benefits **CAN** be granted **WITH** back dated effective dates! You just need to point out in the claim/appeal that the VA failed to rate the issues in the previous decision and **EXPLAIN** why the VA should have considered it or that you meet the criteria of a grant previously and the VA failed to grant.

- Commonly missed ancillary benefits are things like [Special Monthly Compensation (SMC)](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/smc)  and [Chapter 35](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/survivorbenefits#dea)

- Commonly missed inferred conditions are things like [Residual scars](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/skin#7802)  and secondary [Nerve issues](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/nerveindex)  due to a [Spine](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/spine)  condition.

- NOTE: Inferring issues became policy circa 2014. So missed inferred issues prior to this year **CANNOT** be considered.
- The VA does not have a form for forgotten claims or CUES; So you can file via a [Personal statement](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/personal)  or on a [(20-0995)](http://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-20-0995-ARE.pdf)  to help the VA with keeping track of the claim.

### CUE Examples

- Assigning incorrect SMC coding on codesheet

- [Bilateral factor](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vamath#bilateral)  was not set properly in the master record (the codesheet derives its information from the master record)

- Rater set your left ankle as a right ankle. This can result in being underpaid if the bilateral factor would have increased your combined evaluation. The master record is mentioned here because the codesheet does **NOT** display what bilateral factor is selected by the rater; only what diagnostic codes have an active bilateral factor that is impacting your combined evaluation.
- Conditions given a singular rating that should be rated separately

- Conditions given separate ratings that should have been given a combined singular evaluation

- [Effective dates](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/edate)

- Missing intents to file, that claim was filed within a year of separation, not applying [Liberalizing law](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/edate#lib)  etc.
- Granting/Denying service-connection/benefits

- [Rating](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/ratingsindex)  (too high or too low)

- Rating decision took an action that resulted in reduced disability compensation payments and due process was **NOT** provided

## **Frequently** **Asked Questions**

- #### How do I check the status of my appeal?

- You can check the status of your appeals on [VA.gov](http://va.gov/)  by calling 1 (800) 827-1000, or making a [VERA appointment](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vera)

- #### I filed my HLR/Supplemental claim via QuickSubmit and it has not shown up online yet?

- It can take a week or two before it will show up online.

- #### My appeal shows closed but my conditions are still unchanged. Have I been denied?

- It is possible, however the VA websites often do not update everything at the same time. So give it another day.

- Alternatively, if you filed an HLR. If an error was found that required the VA to obtain new evidence then your HLR will be administratively closed and re-opened as a supplemental claim.

- #### You mentioned other power/authority DROs have?

- In addition to the ability to issue differences of opinions: DROs are allowed to declare CUEs (that do not harm the vet) without getting another person to approve their determination.

- #### During my HLR the VA found a duty to assist error and are sending me to another C&P exam. Can I now submit additional evidence, if I have some?

- Yes, your appeal has now become a supplemental claim. So you are free to [Submit](https://eauth.va.gov/accessva/?cspSelectFor=quicksubmit)  any new and relevant evidence to your claim.

- #### How do I change review options at the Board?

- Fill out a new Board Appeal form. Make sure you check the box for the new review option, and list all of the issues.

- **IMPORTANT:** You have **one year** from the date on the decision, or **60 days** from the date that you submitted your Board Appeal, whichever is later to make this change!

- #### How do I request different Board review options for different issues?

- You can submit one Board Appeal form and attach additional pages to explain how you want your issues reviewed, or you can submit multiple Board Appeal forms â€“ one for each review option.

- #### I lost my BVA appeal, what can I do now?

- If you disagree with the Boardâ€™s decision and have new and relevant evidence that supports your case, you can file a Supplemental Claim. You can also appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims.

- #### How do I change my appeal from a Board Appeal to Supplemental Claim or Higher-Level Review?

- Tell the Board in writing that you wish to withdraw your Board Appeal. Then you can file a Supplemental Claim or Higher-Level Review.

- #### Should I hire an attorney/claims agent?

- That is a personal decision. However, unless your appeal hangs on a certain legal issue/angle then the benefit they provide may not be there.

- #### Can I file an appeal a specific condition decision, or do I have to appeal the entire claim?

- You can appeal a single decision, two, all of them, etc. Do know you **CANNOT** appeal the same condition via multiple appeal types at the same time!

- #### On the supplemental claim form, what does "Check this box if any issue listed below is being withdrawn from the legacy appeals process. OPT-IN from SOC/SSOC"?

- This box only applies to Veterans who are wanting to convert their 'legacy appeal' to the modern appeal processes. In short, unless you have been in a continuous appeal since circa 2017, this box does **NOT** apply to you and **CAN** be ignored.

- #### If I file an appeal, can the VA reduce my ratings?

- Yes, by filing an appeal you invite the VA to review your file. If it is found that a Clear and Unmistakable Error occurred and you were rated either too high or that service-connection was granted in error, the VA **WILL** start action to fix the error! That said, a mere difference of opinion is **NOT** enough! Further, if exams are ordered as apart of you claim and it is found that your condition(s) have improved, the VA _can_ start action to reduce you!

- #### Will I need to resubmit evidence that I previously submitted?

- No, the VA permanently keeps **ALL** records they receive.

- #### Will my pay be paused while the VA works on my appeal?

- Your pay will continue as appropriate, during the appeals process.

- #### Can I file multiple appeals on a single supplemental or HLR form?

- Yes.

- #### Will filing an appeal slow down any active claims/appeals I have?

- No, each appeal is processed separately from all other claims/appeals.

- In the event a separate appeal/claim hinges on the out outcome of its sister, then just the entangled issue(s) will be held in a waiting pattern till the primary issue is decided.

- #### Can I use a BVA case as evidence to support my own appeal?

- No, BVA cases do **NOT** establish precedence, only CAVC courts and higher do. However, you can try and use arguments presented in those cases.

- #### If I file a supplemental claim will I get new exam(s)?

- It is typical to get new exams or [Medical opinions](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/imo)  when you file a supplemental. However, if your appeal does not properly address the rationale for the denial it may be found not appropriate to order you exams/opinions.

- #### My attorney/claim agent told me NOT TO TALK to the VA and that all communication needs to go through them?

- This is generally **VERY BAD** advice and serves more to drag out the length of an appeal (more money for them) than it would help you.

- Further the VA will **NOT** honor a request for â€œexclusive contactâ€ wherein the VA is prohibited from contacting the Veteran. You can of course refuse to respond/speak with the VA, as is your right - but you may find it best to answer questions as appropriate, especially if they are for the purposes of clarification.

## [**Burial Allowance**](https://www.va.gov/burials-memorials/veterans-burial-allowance/)

This benefit helps cover burial, funeral, and transportation costs.

* * *

<!-- Chunk 1066/1206 | Heading: [Burial Allowance](https://www.va.gov/burials-memorials/veterans-burial-allowance/) | Words: 15 -->

---

### Eligibility

There are three kinds of burial allowances: Non-Service Connected (NSC), Service-Connected (SC) and Death Under Care. Burial benefits are made up of the burial allowance itself, Plot benefits, and Transportation benefit.

Not every Veteran's survivors are entitled to a Burial allowance. If your Veteran was not in receipt of benefits at death, did not have a pending claim at death, or did not pass away under care, the claim for Burial benefits will very likely be denied.

- **NSC Death**: This is VA's version of the [Social Security $255 Lump Sum Death Benefit](https://www.ssa.gov/forms/ssa-8.html)  The Veteran had to have been in receipt of benefits at the time of death ( [Compensation](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vaclaim)  or [Pension](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/pension)

- The current _Maximum_ Burial Allowance is $978 and $978 for a plot.
- **SC Death**: This is VA's burial decision indicating that the Veteran's death was somehow tied to their military service. The biggest driver of this is the combination of issues that the Veteran was rated for during their lifetime and the published cause of death on the death certificate. If you select SC Burial as an option on the application and that link is **NOT** obvious, you will get a letter asking you to provide scientific or medical evidence.

- The _Maximum_ Burial allowance is $2,000.

- Alternatively, if the Veteran is buried in a VA national cemetery - the whole costs of moving the remains _may_ be covered.
- **Death Under Care**: Those not in receipt can only be awarded Burial benefits if they died under care. Dying under care is an unofficial catch-all to describe death that happens at or in transit to/from a Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC), death at a State Veterans Home, or death at a contract nursing home. The nursing home that a Veteran deceased at would have been arranged by the local VAMC to qualify as death under care.

- The current _Maximum_ Burial Allowance is $978 and $978 for a plot.

Additionally, copies of the following documents need to be attached:

- The Veteranâ€™s military discharge papers (DD214 or other separation documents);

- The Veteranâ€™s name;

- The type of service or item purchased;

- Any credits; and

- The amount paid.

## **Burial or Inurnment in Arlington National Cemetery**

Certain Veterans are eligible to be interned or inurned, in Arlington National Cemetery.

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- Veterans who are convicted of certain crimes are made ineligible. This **DOES** include those who died **BEFORE** being sentencing or who fled sentencing. However, if the Veteran somehow gets commuted, they **WILL** regain their eligibility.

- Federal or State capital crimes.

- Crimes that lead to a person becoming a Title III sex offender for purposes of the [Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act](https://www.law.cornell.edu/topn/sex_offender_registration_and_notification_act)  and whose crime carried with it a minimum sentence of life imprisonment.

" _Grief is the price we pay for love_." \- _Queen Elizabeth_ II

While death is the end of oneâ€™s life it is merely the beginning of a gauntlet for those who must carry on in their absence. While it is important to go over this to-do list to help prevent over payments (debts) - if you need a few days to catch a breath and decompress before moving on, take them! Just try to get to it within a month of death.

Hopefully, death didnâ€™t come suddenly and without warning like an _ACME_ _anvil_ from above - but even if it did you will be able to get through these difficult times.

- Car, house, utilities, etc.

- **IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- You are **NOT** required to accept the debt of the departed (if you are not party to the debt). Meaning if you did not co-sign things then the debt is (generally) owed just by the Veteranâ€™s estate. So if they had a mountain of credit card debt you do **NOT** have to assume the debt!

- Contact the VA at 1-800-827-1000.

- Contact their life insurance compan(ies) for all their life insurance policies.

- You will generally need to provide the policy number and a certified copy of the death certificate and fill out a claim form.

- If the deceased is listed as the beneficiary on any other policy, arrange to have their name removed.

- If the Veteran was enrolled in the Servicememberâ€™s Group Life Insurance plan (SGLI), Veteranâ€™s Group Life Insurance (VGLI), or Family SGLI (FSGLI) call the VA at 1-877-832-4943.

- If the Veteran was enrolled in other VA policies such as Service-Disabled Veterans Insurance (S-DVI) and VALife call the VA at 1-800-669-8477.
- Banking/Investments:

- Change any joint bank accounts into just your name.

- If the deceased's estate is in trust, check with the Trust Department or Customer Service at the bank.

- Contact the banks/companies that held their investments to have assets transferred.
- If the deceased owned a car, transfer the automobile title into your name at the Secretary of State's Office, or if the estate is probated, through Probate Court.

- Seek the advice of an accountant or tax advisor about filing the deceased's tax return for the year of the death. Keep monthly bank statements on all individual and joint accounts that show the account balance on the day of death, since you will need this information for the estate tax return.

- If the Veteran dies and the former spouse remarries, theyâ€™ll no longer be eligible for the DEA benefits **UNLESS**:

- New marriage was on or after January 1, 2004, and you were at least 57 years old, **or**

- New marriage ends due to death or divorce.
- Till August 1, 2026, children who attend an [Approved high school](https://www.va.gov/education/gi-bill-comparison-tool/)  can use DEA benefits for up to 5 months ( [PL 117-328](https://www.congress.gov/117/plaws/publ328/PLAW-117publ328.pdf)

- The 5 months do **NOT** count towards the DEA benefit limits.

- The childâ€™s high school campus counselor or College and Career Facilitator generally acts as the School's Certifying Official (SCO).

- For a high school to be approved the high school must request approval from the State Approving Agency of their state. Which is not generally a quick process meaning - if they are not already approved by now they likely wonâ€™t be before the program expires.

## [**Survivor Benefit Plan**](https://militarypay.defense.gov/Benefits/Survivor-Benefit-Program/Overview/)  **/** [**Reserve Component Benefit Plan**](https://www.dfas.mil/retiredmilitary/provide/rcsbp/)  **(SBP)/(RCSBP)**

The Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) allows a military retiree to ensure, after death, a continuous lifetime annuity (monthly pay) for their dependents. The annuity is based on a percentage of retired pay and **IS** an inflation-adjusted!

Premiums for SBP coverage are taken from pre-tax retiree pay; which saves you money (vs. paying from post-tax). The average premium are well below the cost for a conventional insurance policy so for most retirees, SBP is a good choice.

The maximum SBP annuity payment for a spouse is 55% of the member's retired pay (or in the case of a member who retires under REDUX, the retired pay the member would have received if under the high-three retirement system). However, a smaller amount may be elected.

Eligible children may also be SBP beneficiaries, either alone or added to spouse coverage. In the latter case, the children receive benefits only if the spouse dies or otherwise becomes ineligible to receive the annuity. Eligible children equally divide a benefit that is 55% of the member's elected base amount. Child coverage is relatively inexpensive because children get benefits only while they are considered eligible dependents.

Coverage is also available for a former spouse or, if the retiree has no spouse or children, for an "insurable interest" (such as a business partner or parent).

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- Surviving spouses maintain their eligibility until death, as long as they do **NOT** remarry before the age of 55. If the spouse remarries before age 55, payments will stop!

- However, if the marriage later ends for _any_ reason, their eligibility for the annuity is returned and just needs to be [Managed](https://www.dfas.mil/RetiredMilitary/survivors/manage/)

Unfortunately, there is a lot of misinformation and confusion that surround this button. But here is the truth in the matter:

There are only **FOUR** cases in which pressing this button _maybe_ does anything:

1. You submitted a [Supplemental claim](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals#995)  and did **NOT** select anything in the 5103 notice acknowledged block _or_ you selected you would like the VA to send it.

2. Your POA submitted your [Claim](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vaclaim)  or [Appeal](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals)

3. You filed for [TDIU](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/tdiu)  and did **NOT** include a [VA Form 21-526EZ](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/vba-21-526ez-are.pdf)

4. You filed for [Aid and Attendance/SMC](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/smc)  and did **NOT** include a [VA Form 21-526EZ](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/vba-21-526ez-are.pdf)

* * *

<!-- Chunk 1162/1206 | Heading: 'Ask VA to Decide My Claim' Button | Words: 170 -->

---

## **What the Button Actually Does**

Pressing the button adds a document to your [Claim file](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/cfile)  that says you have submitted all evidence you plan on submitting.

* * *

<!-- Chunk 1163/1206 | Heading: What the Button Actually Does | Words: 30 -->

---

### How this can Help

- If you fit any of the listed cases above, and the VA _forgot_ to send you a [5103 notice](https://www.benefits.va.gov/COMPENSATION/notice.asp)  and you did not fit a sub-scenario where one need not be sent (I will not go into them). Asking the VA to decide your claim fulfills the 5103 notice requirement. In effect saving you from having to wait a month, whenever someone at the VA realizes no one ever sent the notice out.

So yes, for those who say it does nothing... You are right in the _vast majority_ of cases.

<!-- Chunk 1164/1206 | Heading: How this can Help | Words: 97 -->

---

## **Frequently** **Asked Questions**

- #### If I press the button can I still submit evidence?

- The button is non-binding, you can continue to submit additional evidence.

- #### Will pressing the button prevent the VA from obtaining evidence?

- No, the VA is still free to obtain evidence. This **DOES** include ordering [Compensation and Pension Examinations](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/cnp)

- #### I can't find this button!?

- While logged into the [va.gov](http://va.gov/)  website (â€œ>â€ means click): Home>Check your claims and appeals>Files for your compensation claim

- Scroll down under â€œadditional evidenceâ€ you should have a spot to submit more stuff, and you will also see the button to â€œask for a claim decisionâ€.

- #### I see a "Request type: Automated 5103 Notice Response" "No longer needed" What is this?

- This is generated when the VA sends the 5103 notice. The no longer needed just means the VA is no longer waiting for the button press as the wait time has passed.

If you are between **180-90 days** _before_ separation you can file a BDD claim within that window of time.

Ideally, this will allow your claim to get a head-start and get you a decision the day after you separate - butâ€¦ this is _not_ always the case.

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- You **MUST** submit your Service Treatment Records (STRs) **NO LATER THAN 90 DAYS BEFORE** you separate from Active Duty. Failure to do so **WILL** result in your claim being removed from the BDD program! Specifically, the VA is requires your _Separation Health Assessment - Part A Self-Assessment (SHA, Part A)_.

- Private medical records (treatment outside a military provider) is generally **NOT** included into your STRs unless **YOU** have them added. Ask your base medical how they want to go about this. They should accept copies of those records or have a fax number the providers can send your records to.

- You can obtain your STRs [HERE](https://patientportal.mhsgenesis.health.mil/)

- You can upload evidence via this [LINK](https://eauth.va.gov/accessva/?cspSelectFor=quicksubmit)
- If some records are missing/incomplete that is fine - just submit what you can for now!
- You do **NOT** need to attend all your exams before the window closes or even before you separate.

- **ALWAYS** keep the VA updated of your location! That way they can properly notify you any [Examinations](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/#cnp)

- BDD claims **CANNOT** have ratings finalized till the day **AFTER** you officially separate from active duty!

- If you had a previous period of service and had claimed condition(s) denied, you **MUST** file an appropriate [Appeal](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals)  to re-claim those denied issues!

- If you decide to file for additional conditions when you are _under 90 days_ to separation, a separate claim **WILL** be created while the BDD continues as a BDD claim!

- Intents to file mean **NOTHING** for a BDD claim as the effective date of any grants **CANNOT** be earlier than the day **AFTER** you separate from the military.

**RATER NOTES:**

- Seriously, if you have **NOT** been seen in-service for your claimed condition(s) it is **CRITICAL**that you file **_BEFORE_** you separate! It **WILL GREATLY** help you in getting [Service-connection](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/serviceconnection)  So even if it might delay you getting a decision it **WILL GREATLY** help you in the end!

- Seriously, the bar to get service-connection gets **NO LOWER** than when you file a claim while **STILL ON ACTIVE DUTY**! In short, in **MOST** cases so long as you can get a _current diagnosis_ you will get service-connection!

NOTES:

- BDD claims _are_ given [Priority](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/fast)  in terms of claims processing.

- All conditions will be considered under [Primary service-connection](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/serviceconnection)  even if they are factually due to another condition.

- Unless there is clear and unmistakable evidence the condition was preexisting, then the VA will consider under [Aggravation](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/agg)

<!-- Chunk 1169/1206 | Heading: Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD) | Words: 526 -->

## **Filing a BDD Claim**

To file a BDD claim online by yourself, you can go to [VA.gov](https://www.va.gov/disability/how-to-file-claim/)

Alternatively, you can have a [Veterans Service Officer (VSO)](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vso)  assist you in filing a claim.

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- If you are having a VSO file your BDD claim, you **MUST** be the one who signs the claim paperwork (if this is your first ever claim)!

- You do **NOT** need to have a diagnosis to claim something!

## **Viewing Exam Reports**

Active Duty service members who have filed a BDD claim **ARE** be able to access their [Compensation & Pension](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/cnp)  Examiner Reports' via the [MHS Genesis](https://myaccess.dmdc.osd.mil/identitymanagement/app/login)  under medical records > documents.

These will usually show up there in around 30 days after the examination is completed.

You can use these as a sneak-peak to try and predict what rating(s) you may get by comparing the results with the [Rating schedule](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/ratingsindex)

## **Frequently** **Asked Questions**

- #### When is the VA going to order my exams!?

- Really hard to say, depending on local conditions (how backed up examiners are), it can take beyond your separation date. But ideally, you should have your exams sorted out within two months of filing.

- #### How long will it be before my claim is rated?

- The million dollar question! Ideally, the VA would have your rating ready to go, the day after you separate. However, it rarely happens that way. Realistically, you should get a decision in one-three months after separation.

- #### Who gave the VA a time machine! My claim status shows a date in the future?

- The date shown is the date after you separate from the military. This is because your [Effective date](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/edate)  cannot be any earlier.

- #### Do I have to explain how I developed a condition?

- No, when you joined the military you did so with a presumption of soundness - meaning you were 100% healthy (barring anything brought up at MEPS). So the fact something popped up while you were in service means you are good to go (unless it is something the VA will [NOT service connect](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/NoRate)

- #### My separation date changed! Do I need to do anything?

- Call the VA (1-800-827-1000) and let them know whats is going on, as a courtesy.

- #### Whoops, looks like I am just gonna stay in the military. Do I need to do anything?

- Yes! Submit a [Personal statement](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/personal)  explaining the situation. Failure to do so _may_ result in a debt being created - if the VA starts paying you!

- #### The website is not letting me submit a claim online! I get a message to contact the VA and the phone people are not able to help me!

- Looks like you ran into a technical issue (welcome to the VA!). If the VA is unable to sort this issue out and your BDD window is closing fast you should submit your claim via a [VSO](https://veteransbenefitskb.com//vso)  or via fax: 844-531-7818.

- #### I am in the National Guard/Reserves can I file a BDD claim?

- Yes, if you are on Active Duty or Title 32 orders (and you are in the BDD window) - you **CAN** file a BDD claim.

- #### Oh no! VA sent me a letter saying they were removeing me from the BDD program!

- Your claim will continue but without the benefit of BDD priority.

- #### I am almost separated but no exams! What is wrong!?

- Some locations are more backed up than others. So sometimes you may not be able to get all your exams done till after you separate. This will **NOT** remove you from the BDD program!

- #### Should I submitted personal and buddy statements?

- You really do not need to. If you really wanted to, it would generally be helpful with respect to talking about the severity of a condition.

- The following links has information on statements:

- [Personal Statements](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/personal)

- [Buddy Statements](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/buddy)

- #### I forgot to claim something. Can't I just talk to my examiner about it and the VA can grant?

- Certainly talk to your examiner about **ALL** your issues! But know the VA _generally_ **CANNOT** grant things without you formally claiming them!

- In most cases it will be best to formally file claims for those additional conditions (sooner than later).

- #### The rating schedule changed between the time I filed my BDD claim and separation; what rating schedule will I be rated under?

- You will be rated under the rating schedule in effective the day **AFTER** you separate.

- If the rating schedule changed while you were on Active Duty then you **WILL** be rated under the new schedule.

- If the rating schedule changed _2 days or more_ **AFTER** you separate, then youâ€™d be considered under _both_ schedules (assuming a decision wasnâ€™t made exactly on the day after you separated):

- If the new schedule is better youâ€™d be rated under the old schedule till the new schedule became effective.

- If the old schedule is better then youâ€™d be rated under it only.

The Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) uses the [Schedule For Rating Disabilities](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-38/chapter-I/part-4)  in conjunction with the [M21-1 Adjudication Procedures Manual](https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018/topic/554400000004049/M21-1-Adjudication-Procedures-Manual)  to determine what disability evaluation to award Veterans depending upon the severity of their disability and any other applicable policies and regulations.

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- **DO NOT** misuse the schedule! To misrepresent the severity of your condition is a **CRIME**!

- **DO** **NOT** treat the schedule as a check list of things to say _or_ do!

- Please use the schedule more as a means to understand what the VA is looking for. So you have a better understanding of how to explain your impairment or to simply learn how your condition is rated.

## **Extra Scheduler (38 CFR 3.321(b))**

In exceptional or unusual circumstances in which the Veteran has factors such as marked interference with employment or frequent periods of hospitalization, the VA Director of Compensation Service may grant a rating that is higher than what is provided for in the rating schedule. Do know, these cases are exceptionally rare!

## **Hospitalizations (Temporary 100% Rating) (38 CFR 4.29)**

Veterans who are hospitalized at a VA hospital or at an approved hospital for **22 or more** _continuous_ days due to a service-connected condition will be paid at the **100% rate**, going back to the day that they were admitted to the hospital.

This 100% rating will be paid to the end of the month that the Veteran was discharged in and the Veteran will have their evaluation returned to what it was previously\*.

\*Unless the hospitalization lasted at least 6 months due to a [Mental disorder](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)  In such case, the Veteran will continue to receive the 100% rating for 6 months, at which point the Veteran will receive a [Reevaluation](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/cnp)  to determine their current level of disability.

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- The following situations do **NOT** entitle the Veteran to temporary 100%:

- Treatment while a resident in a [State Veteransâ€™ home](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/elderlt#state)

- **UNLESS** actually hospitalized at a medical facility at the home.
- Participating in a live-in/work-out program - used commonly to help transition people to community living; or are

- Resident in a [Domiciliary program](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/38/17.30)

- **UNLESS** the level of care required is comparable to hospital care.

NOTE:

- [VHAâ€™s Mental Health Residential Rehabilitation Treatment Program (MH RRTP)](https://www.mentalhealth.va.gov/get-help/va-residential-rehabilitation/index.asp)  is a type of domiciliary care.

- Depending upon the Veteran's other ratings they may become eligible for [SMC S](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/smc#s)  during their period of convalescence.

### Filing for Temporary 100%

The Veteran can seek the aid of a [VSO](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vso)  or file online on VA.gov. If you file yourself, you can file it as a new claim â€œtemporary 100% due to hospitalizationâ€ and include evidence of the hospitalization or give the VA a [VA Form 21-4142/21-4142a](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/vba-21-4142-are.pdf)  to obtain the records for you.

In order for the VA to grant the temporary 100% the medical evidence **MUST** state:

- The condition(s) which were the cause of the hospitalization; and

- The length of the hospitalization stay.

NOTE:

- If the Veteran is hospitalized at a VA facility, the VA should handle the claim for the Veteran. In this case the Veteran _should_ not need to file themselves.

## **Convalescent Rating (Temporary 100% Rating) (38 CFR 4.30)**

If the Veteran meets at least **ONE** of the following eligibility requirements following their hospital discharge they will be entitled to a temporary single rating of 100%.

Unless the rating schedule specifies, the temporary ratings can range from 1 to 3 months. If a medical professional determines the Veteran needs additional time the Veteran may get file to get extensions up to a total of 6 months. Veterans who may require further extensions can get up to another 6 months if approved by the Veterans Service Center Manager.

* * *

<!-- Chunk 1185/1206 | Heading: Convalescent Rating (Temporary 100% Rating) (38 CFR 4.30) | Words: 100 -->

---

### Eligibility

The surgery or procedure **MUST** be done on something that is _service-connected_ **AND**

- Surgery requires at least 1 month of convalescence;

- Surgery with severe postoperative residuals such as incompletely healed surgical wounds, stumps of recent amputations, therapeutic immobilization of one major joint or more, application of a body cast, the necessity for house confinement, or the necessity for continued use of a wheelchair or crutches (regular weight-bearing prohibited); **OR**

- Immobilization by cast, without surgery, of one major joint or more.

After the convalescent period end the Veteran's disability _may_ be [Reevaluated](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/cnp)  **UNLESS**, the schedule dictates a minimum rating the Veteran.

NOTES:

- Depending upon the Veteran's other ratings they may become eligible for [SMC S](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/smc#s)  during their period of convalescence.

- If the rating schedule specifies a Veteran will get say 6, 12, etc. months of temporary 100% rate, the Veteran will get an additional month of 100%. So the Veteran will in effect have 7, 13, etc. months of temporary 100%.

- If the Veteran retroactively becomes service-connected for something that made them eligible for a convalescent rating, they can file to get back pay - **SO LONG AS** the effective day is _before or during_ the Veteran's convalescent time period.

- If the Veteran needs an extension of their temp 100% due to their condition taking longer to recover, the Veteran can request an extension of up to 3 months by providing the VA medical evidence from their doctor demonstrating the need.

### Filing for Temporary 100%

The Veteran can seek the aid of a [VSO](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vso)  or file online on VA.gov. If you file yourself, you can file it as a new claim â€œtemporary 100% due to convalescenceâ€ and include evidence of the convalescence or give the VA a [VA Form 21-4142/21-4142a](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/vba-21-4142-are.pdf)  to obtain the records for you.

In order for the VA to grant the temporary 100% the medical evidence **MUST** show:

- The condition(s) which were the cause of the convalescence; and

- The length of the convalescence.

Medical evidence **MUST** show (when related to surgery):

- Date of admission;

- Date of discharge;

- Date of surgery;

- The length of the convalescence (if not dictated by the rating schedule); **AND**

- Procedure performed.

- If the procedure is noted for a non-service-connected condition then the VA may get a medical opinion to determine if the non-service-connected condition is a progression of a service-connected condition.

## **Amputation Rule (38 CFR 4.68)**

A Veteran **CANNOT** get a [Combined VA rating](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vamath)  higher for _musculoskeletal_ conditions for a limb than if it was amputated. In the rare cases in which the amputation rule is applied, the conditions that â€˜spill overâ€™ the maximum combined evaluation will be disabled and will **NOT** be applied to your combined disability evaluation!

For example:

- If a Veteran had their right dominant arm amputated above the elbow they would be awarded a rating of 80%.

- A Veteran who had no amputation could **NOT** have a combined VA rating higher than 80% for musculoskeletal conditions that involve their dominant [Elbow/forearm](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/elbowforearm)  [Wrist](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/wrist)  and/or [Hand](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/hand)

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- The amputation rule does **NOT** apply to evaluations of peripheral nerve disabilities of the extremities including, but not limited to: diabetic neuropathy, radiculopathy/sciatica due to a spinal disorder, or peripheral nerve injuries of non-musculoskeletal cause.

- The amputation rule does **NOT** apply to bilateral evaluations assigned under single DCs found in 38 CFR 4.71a, such as those assigned for bilateral foot disabilities, **EXCEPT** when being compared to a bilateral amputation of the same extremities.

## **Pyramiding Rule (38 CFR 4.14)**

The same disability/symptom **CANNOT** be rated twice.

An example would be a Veteran diagnosed with 2 ankle conditions that result in reduced range of motion. The Veteran could **NOT** get 2 separate ratings for each diagnosed condition based on the limitation of motion.

### Common Pyramiding Errors

Newer raters are known to sometimes improperly rate disabilities. As such, sometimes they will rate something separately that they shouldn't. The following are common pyramiding errors. If you have active ratings for any of the following two disabilities. You should contact a VSO **BEFORE** you file any new claims or increases, as the VA may identify the error(s) and fix them - which could result in you ending up with a lower rating than when you started!

- [Sleep apnea](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/airsystem#6847)  & [Asthma](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/airsystem#6602)

- [Median nerve](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/upnerves#8515)  & [Ulnar nerve](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/upnerves#8516)  (same arm)

- [PTSD](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/mental#9411)  & [TBI](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/cns#8045)

\*Unless the examiner _can_ differentiate the symptoms of both; then the rater needs to give the Veteran a separate rating for each.

<!-- Chunk 1190/1206 | Heading: Common Pyramiding Errors | Words: 123 -->

## **Zero Percent Evaluations (38 CFR 4.31)**

In the event the rating schedule does not provide a 0% evaluation, an evaluation of 0% **CAN** still be given if the requirements for a compensable evaluation (over 0%) are not met.

Meaning, just because the schedule shows evaluations starting at say 10% - does **NOT** mean the minimum evaluation for service-connection is set at 10%!

## **Time Based Protections**

Veterans who have held their ratings for the following number of _continuous_ years have the following legal protections. However, if there was fraud involved then there are **NO** protections given! Errors on the part of the VA are **NOT** fraud.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- The date of time based protections start from the effective date of the grant, **NOT** the date of the rating decision!

* * *

<!-- Chunk 1192/1206 | Heading: Time Based Protections | Words: 71 -->

### 5 Years - Reductions (38 CFR 3.344)

A Veteran's rating _generally_ cannot be reduced based upon a single [C&P exam](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/cnp)  that shows the Veteran's disability has improved. This is because **CONTINUOUS** improvement **MUST** be shown when the evaluation has been held for at least 5 _continuous_ years.

In **MOST** cases it will take another exam showing the condition is still improved before the Veteran **WILL** receive a [Proposal for reduction](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/reduction)  (if the reduction reduces your [Combined](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vamath)  evaluation; otherwise the condition will be reduced without notice).

Practical example to be reduced based on **ONE EXAM**:

- The condition is rated on lab results like [Kidney](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/gensystem)  or [Lung function](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/airsystem)  and the VA _happens_ to have lab results that show improvementâ€¦ whelp if _you filed an increase_ for that condition for some reason - you should **EXPECT** a reduction/proposal based if the VA does another lab test because of your claim and it confirms the improvement!

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- This protection does **NOT** reset after 5 years! Meaning if you had an exam showing improvement on year 6 and then another exam shows improvement at year 16, the VA **CAN** still come for blood!

- Ratings for diseases subject to temporary or episodic improvement, e.g., [Manic depressive](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/mental#9433)  or [Other psychotic reaction](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/mental#9411)  [Epilepsy](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/cns#seizure)  [Psychoneurotic reaction](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/mental#9400)  [Arteriosclerotic heart disease](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/heart#7005)  [Bronchial asthma](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/airsystem#6602)  [Gastric or duodenal ulcer](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/digsystem#7304)  many [Skin diseases](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/skin)  etc., will **NOT** be reduced based off of **ONE** examination showing improvement ( **EXCEPT** when all the evidence of record clearly shows that sustained improvement has been shown).

- Conditions granted temporary 100% are **NOT** protected by this regulation!

- Ratings for conditions which become comparatively symptom free (findings absent) after prolonged rest, e.g. residuals of [Phlebitis](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/bloodtubes#7121)  arteriosclerotic heart disease, etc., will **NOT** be reduced on examinations reflecting the improvement is _due_ to _bed rest_.

- **RATER COMMENT**: Yeahâ€¦ soâ€¦ if you _did not_ claim an increase for something unrelated to your claim and there is evidence of improvement - We ainâ€™t gonna go out of our ways to reduce you for that unclaimed/unrelated condition.

### 10 Years - Service-Connection (38 CFR 3.957)

A Veteran's service-connection for a disability **CANNOT** be severed, barring fraud or if it is clearly shown from military records that the Veteran did not have the required service or character of discharge.

NOTES AT 10 YEARS:

- The Veteran's erroneously service-connected condition is eligible for increases, if an increase is warranted.

- If the Veteran's erroneously service-connected condition causes other disabilities, they can be service-connected on a secondary basis.

**_SPECIAL NOTES:_**

- In the event the VA clearly and erroneously grants service-connection for a disability involving a specific location (left vs. right and/or upper vs. lower); the VA **CAN** reassign the location of the grant, even after 10 years. In the event such change results in a reduced evaluation, VA **MUST** provide due process and [Propose](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/proposed)  the change.

- Periods during which a Veteran is returned to Active Duty do **NOT** count for the purposes of calculating this protection!

### 20 Years - Total Protection (38 CFR 3.951)

A Veteran's entitlement to a benefit/rating **CANNOT** be severed/reduced, barring fraud!

**_SPECIAL NOTES:_**

- In the event the VA clearly and erroneously grants service-connection for a disability involving a specific location (left vs. right and/or upper vs. lower); the VA **CAN** reassign the location of the grant, even after 20 years. In the event such change results in a reduced evaluation, VA **MUST** provide due process and propose the change.

- Periods during which a Veteran is returned to Active Duty do **NOT** count for the purposes of calculating this protection!

- The pausing of [SMC](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/smc)  (based on need for aid and attendance) **IS** allowed when hospitalized at government expense!

\*Condition A has been held for 10 years, no matter the rating percentage. However, the 5 year protection **ONLY** applies to the 10% rating and **NOT** the newly increased rating of 30%.

\*\*Only the 10% rating has the 20 year protection, as it has been held for 20 years.

### Amputation

In the event that a Veteran has a non-service-connected **OR** service-connected amputation that removes something that was service-connected, the Veteran's rating will continue in force and **NOT** be reduced or removed.

### Changes in the Schedule

In the event that the rating schedule changes, the Veteran will be grandfathered under the older schedule.

Do know that in the event it is found that the Veteran has improved under their grandfathered schedule **AND** the new schedule, the Veteran will then have their evaluation reduced/ [Proposed to be reduced](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/reduction)  and rated per the current rating schedule (assuming they do **NOT** have a protected evaluation).

If over the life of a claim the schedule changes, the Veteran's condition will be evaluated based upon the schedule in force on the [Effective date](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/edate)  of the grant. **IF** the new schedule is better then a [Stag](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/edate#staged)  [ed](https://www.reddit.com/r/VeteranBenefits/wiki/edate/#wiki_staged_effective_dates)  evaluation will be given, from the date of the schedule change.

### Aged over 55

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- This is a common misconception as it is **NOT** actually a form of rating protection!

What being aged over 55 or more _does_ do is:

- The VA will not establish regularly scheduled reexaminations - in most cases. Effectively, making the condition static.

- However, some conditions do [Require](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mandatory)  regularly scheduled reexaminations such as:

- Cancers; and

- Infectious diseases such as [Tuberculous](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/infect#6730)

So, if the Veteran decides to file a claim on a [Secondary basis](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/claimtype#secondary)  The VA _could possibly_ reevaluate the primary condition, and if appropriate - reduce the rating of the primary condition!

## **Incarcerated and Fugitive Felon Veterans**

Veterans who are incarcerated in a Federal, State or local penal institution in **excess of 60 days** for conviction of a **FELONY** _or_ are a fugitive felon will have their disability compensation reduced/stopped.

* * *

<!-- Chunk 1200/1206 | Heading: Incarcerated and Fugitive Felon Veterans | Words: 42 -->

### Reduced Pay

Incarcerated Veterans have their pay reduced!

- Rated 20% or higher:

- Veteran will be paid at the 10% rate.
- Rated 10%, paid at 10%, or getting **ONLY** [Special Monthly Compensations (SMC) K](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/smc)

- Veteran will be paid **HALF** the rate of 10%.
- [VA Pension](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/pension)  (reduction may be due to either a felony conviction **_OR_** _misdemeanor)_:

- No pay at all.
- [Clothing allowance](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/clothes)

- If the institution provides clothing _without_ cost:

- Will have their clothing allowance reduced by X/365 for each day they are incarcerated - starting from the 61st day.

Fugitive Felons will have **ALL BENEFITS STOPPED**!

NOTE:

- Any SMCs will **NOT** be paid to the Veteran.

* * *

<!-- Chunk 1201/1206 | Heading: Reduced Pay | Words: 119 -->

---

### Apportionment

If the Veteran's spouse/dependents rely on the Veteran's disability compensation, they may file to have all or part of the money that was reduced from the Veteran's compensation paid to themselves. This claim will be based upon a demonstrated need.

To file for apportionment [_VA Form 21-0788_](http://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-21-0788-ARE.pdf)  must be completed, signed by either the Veteran _or_ their dependent(s), and submitted to the VA _._

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- In the event the Veteran becomes a fugitive felon apportionment **WILL BE DISCONTINUED**!

- If the Veteran's conviction is overturned on appeal, the Veteran's disability pay _minus_ any apportioned money will be returned to the Veteran!

## **Frequently** **Asked Questions**

- #### What happens when the schedule changes?

For existing evaluations:

- The Veteran will be grandfathered under the older schedule and nothing will _automatically_ happen.

- If the new schedule just so happens to be better, the Veteran would need to file for an increase.
- If the Veteran files for an increase, they will be evaluated based upon the **NEW** schedule.

- In the event it is found that the Veteran has improved under both the new **AND** the grandfathered schedule, the Veteran will then have their rating reduced and rated per the current rating schedule (if their evaluation is not [Protected](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/#protection)

For ongoing claims/appeals during a new schedule becoming active:

- The VA will look at both schedules and will use the most favorable one for the Veteran.

- Do know that if the new schedule is used, the effective date can be **NO** earlier than the day the new schedule became active.

- #### Do I Need to Seek Treatment to Maintain My Ratings?

- No, a Veteran does not need to seek treatment through the VA or otherwise to maintain their ratings. (Some Veterans get confused about this, because Social Security does have this requirement.)

- #### Can My Disability Ratings be Lowered if my Disabilities Improve Due to Medications, other Treatments, or Surgeries?

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- In **MOST** cases, unless you file a new claim for increase, the VA will **NOT** just come looking at your previously rated conditions!

**CONTINUOUS Medication Usage:**

- If the schedule specifically mentions medication usage - the Veteran will be rated as stated. This generally results in the Veteran getting a higher rating.

- If the schedule does **NOT** mention medication usage - so long as the Veteran continues to take their medication they should **NOT** be reduced! [(Jones V. Shinseki (2012))](https://efiling.uscourts.cavc.gov/cmecf/servlet/TransportRoom?servlet=ShowDoc&dls_id=01202200801&caseId=70758&dktType=dktPublic)

**Non-Continuous Medication Usage:**

- The Veteran will be rated upon where their symptoms settle at.

**Other Treatments/Surgeries**

- Once treatment ends, the Veteran will be rated\* upon where their symptoms settle at.

- If after surgery you qualify for a [Convalescent rating](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/30)  of temporary 100%, the Veteran will be [Reevaluated](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/cnp)  (unless the schedules lists a minimum evaluation).

\*If and when the Veteran has a reevaluation.
