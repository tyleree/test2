The Yellow Ribbon Program helps cover the increased costs of non-resident tuition. As well as those attending private or foreign institutions that charge more than the maximum amount covered by the [Post 9/11 GI Bill](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills).

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- Public colleges/universities **MUST** now charge 'out-of-state' students using the Post 9/11 GI Bill in-state resident tuition rates. Simply, the time needed to reside in a state or obtain things like a in-state drivers license are waived. **HOWEVER**, the student must still meet the institution's residency requirements in terms of living within the same state as the institution.
