You do **NOT** have to wait months for your [C-file](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/cfile), fight with a [VSO](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vso), or the 1-800 number people to find out what conditions of yours are static ( **NOT** subject to [Regular Future Evaluations](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mandatory))! As a bonus, this method will also show what [Diagnostic Code](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/diagnosticcodes) the condition was rated/considered under.

## **Steps to Find Out What Conditions Are Static**

1. Log into [Va.gov](https://www.va.gov/).

2. In a **_NEW TAB_** go to: [https://api.va.gov/v0/rated\_disabilities](https://api.va.gov/v0/rated_disabilities)

3. The lines which read “static\_ind” show if the condition is static or not.

   - true means the condition is static.

   - false means the condition is **NOT** static.

For those who use the Chrome browser, be sure to select “Pretty-print” at the top left of your window to make things readable.

## **Frequently** **Asked Questions**

- #### The link does not work I got an ERROR!






- If you got an “{"errors":\[{"title":"Not found","detail":"There are no routes matching your request: v0/rated\_disabilties","code":"411","status":"404"}\]}” error message

  - That likely means your login timed out on va.gov and/or your closed the tab that held your va.gov log in.

  - Alternatively, those using an IOS device (Apple) try using the Safari browser (see the compass icon on the bottom right of your screen).

- #### I just cannot get it to work?






- If you are unable to check online:

  - You can request your C-File which will contain your code sheet. The code sheet will list all the conditions and whether the conditions are static or not.

  - Your [VSO](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vso) also may be able to obtain your code sheet for you.

  - If you are exceptionally lucky the VA’s 1-800 people may also tell you.

- #### Some of my denied issues are not marked static?






- Most raters are not going to take their time to mark denied issues as static since it just doesn’t matter.

  - If it is not marked static it is not like VA is going to reevaluate it… as well… it is not considered related to service. So there would be no point in it.

- #### Huh? I am permanent and total but I have service-connected conditions not marked as static?






- One of three things could be happening here:


1. 1\. You are permanent and total without the non-static condition(s);

2. 2\. When VA migrated files from mostly paper to digital - some conditions were not properly marked as static when they are in-fact static; _or_

3. 3\. The rater made a Clear and Unmistakable Error (CUE). Generally, the next rater who gets the file will make appropriate corrections/proposals.


  - In any case, there is not anything you need to do.

- #### I tripled checked the VA math and the condition(s) that make up my 100% evaluation are static but I was not awarded permanent and total?






- While uncommon, sometimes raters overlook a grant of P&T. Whenever you are 100% combined and your conditions _are_ static, but P&T was **NOT** awarded, the VA will _automatically_ establish an audit (usually within 2 weeks of the rating decision). These audits are conducted by a human who will then give you a grant of P&T, assuming there are no other issues at play.

- If no audit was ever started, you can:

  - Make a [VERA appointment](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vera) and ask if they could have their coach (supervisor) make an EP930 to control for the missed issue of entitlement to depent’s educational assistance;

  - If within a year of **ANY** rating decision; filing a [Higher Level Review (HLR)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals) and cite “Missed issue of dependents’ educational assistance; **_OR_**

  - [File a claim](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vaclaim) for “Entitlement to Dependent’s Educational Assistance, due to being permanent and total”.

  - A rater will review your file and grant if appropriate.
