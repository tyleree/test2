| ### **7.G.1.a. Handling Vacated Decisions** |  | If the Board grants a motion for reconsideration (MFR), a motion to vacate, or a motion for revision based on clear and unmistakable error (CUE), the action has the effect of vacating the Board’s original decision(s) on the issue(s).<br>In this case, the legacy appeal will again stand in an “undecided status” and the Board will consider all relevant evidence received since the regional office (RO) decision. The RO will take no action to implement the vacated decision. |

| ### ****7.G.1.b. Handling Board Decisions on a CUE**** |  | Under [38 CFR 3.105(a)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=&SID=88bd95962eae799741a336e8978b5c8c&mc=true&n=pt38.1.3&r=PART&ty=HTML#se38.1.3_1105), a CUE concerning a final unappealed RO decision may not be considered when the Board has reviewed the entire record of the claim and has decided to continue the denial of the previously unappealed decision.<br>After the Board affirms the prior denial of benefits, the claimant must receive a<br>- decision notice that includes a notice of appellate rights, and<br>  <br>- statement of the case (SOC) that includes a citation to [VAOPGCPREC 14-1995](https://vaww.vrm.km.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_kanew/help/agent/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001034/content/554400000043586/VAOPGCPREC-14-95,-May-12,-1995,-Reviewability-of-Unappealed-Regional-Office-Decision-for-Clear-and-Unmistakable-Error---Effect-of-Subsequent-BVA-Action).<br>  <br>**_Important_**: The Board has the authority to determine, on a _de novo_ basis, whether a claim has been properly reopened, and to reverse any finding as to whether new and material evidence exists to reopen the claim.<br>For example: The Veteran files a claim raising allegations of CUE in a 1976 RO denial of service connection. The Veteran did not appeal the 1976 decision, and it became final. The Veteran reopened the claim in 1979 by submitting new and material evidence. The RO denied the reopened claim in 1979, and the Veteran appealed to the Board.<br>In 1981, the Board, after reviewing the evidence of record, denied service connection. In 1986, upon reconsideration, the Board affirmed the 1981 decision, concluding that the decision did not involve obvious error and is final. The Veteran then claimed CUE in the original, 1976, RO decision.<br>ROs do not have jurisdiction to review a claim of CUE in an unappealed rating decision if, following reopening of the claim, a later Board decision included a review of the entire record and affirmed the prior denial of benefits in the unappealed decision.<br>**_Reference_**: For more information on determining jurisdiction of CUE claims, see [VAOPGCPREC 14-1995](https://vaww.vrm.km.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_kanew/help/agent/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001034/content/554400000043586/VAOPGCPREC-14-95,-May-12,-1995,-Reviewability-of-Unappealed-Regional-Office-Decision-for-Clear-and-Unmistakable-Error---Effect-of-Subsequent-BVA-Action). |

| ### ****7.G.1.c.        Board Authority to Review Evidence That Was Not Considered by the RO**** |  | The Board has the authority to consider new evidence without remanding the case to the RO for initial consideration or obtaining the appellant’s waiver of the right for initial consideration by the RO.<br>**_Reference_**:For more information on the Board’s authority to consider additional evidence that was not previously considered by the RO, see<br>- the former[38 U.S.C. 7105(e)](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2016-title38/html/USCODE-2016-title38-partV-chap71-sec7105.htm)<br>  <br>- [M21-5, Chapter 7, Section F, 3.b](https://vaww.vrm.km.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_kanew/help/agent/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001034/content/554400000139892/M21-5-Chapter-7-Section-F-Docketing-Certification-and-Claims-Folder-Transfer-to-the-Board-of-Veterans-Appeals#3b), and<br>  <br>- _[Public Law (PL) 112-154, Section 501](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-112publ154/pdf/PLAW-112publ154.pdf)_. |

| ### **7.G.1.d.  Determining When an Examination Is Needed for Board Grants** |  | When effectuating a grant of service connection (SC), the medical and lay evidence in the claims folder must be reviewed to determine if it is sufficient to establish the appropriate level of disability evaluation for the period of entitlement covered by the grant of benefits.  If the evidence is not sufficient to establish a current evaluation, an adequate examination must be obtained. All evidence of record should be reviewed in the event that a staged rating is required. <br>_**Note**_: If the evidence of record is insufficient to establish an appropriate evaluation, service connection should be granted while the issue of evaluation is deferred for an examination, and the End Product (EP) continued.<br>**_References_**:  For more information on<br>- determining when an examination is needed, see<br>  <br>  - [38 CFR 3.159(c)(4)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=9dd8e2f19f86b409e1ef4b0ff0aced33&mc=true&node=se38.1.3_1159&rgn=div8)<br>    <br>  - [38 CFR 3.326](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=9dd8e2f19f86b409e1ef4b0ff0aced33&mc=true&node=se38.1.3_1326&rgn=div8), and<br>    <br>  - [M21-1, Part IV, Subpart i, 2.A.1.f](https://vaww.vrm.km.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_kanew/help/agent/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001034/content/554400000180498/M21-1-Part-IV-Subpart-i-Chapter-2-Section-A-Examination-Requests-Overview#1)<br>- disability evaluations, see [38 CFR 4.1](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=9dd8e2f19f86b409e1ef4b0ff0aced33&mc=true&node=se38.1.4_11&rgn=div8)<br>  <br>- determining effective dates for Board grants, see [M21-5, Chapter 7, Section G, 1.g](https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018/content/554400000140917/M21-5-Chapter-7-Section-G-Board-of-Veterans-Appeals-Board-Decisions-and-Remands#1g), and<br>  <br>- Partial rating decisions, see [M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 3.B.1.b.](https://vaww.vrm.km.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_kanew/help/agent/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001034/content/554400000180487/M21-1-Part-V-Subpart-ii-Chapter-3-Section-B-Making-Partial-Rating-Decisions) |

| ### ****7.G.1.e. Reviewing the Claims Folder and/or Implementing the Board Decision**** |  | When a decision has been made, the Board returns the claim to the Decision Review Operations Center (DROC) or the RO for review of the claims folder and implementation of the decision, if necessary.

**_Important_**:  The assigned DROC or RO should implement the Board’s grant or partial grant of benefits in any favorable decision _before_ initiating development of the remand.

Use the table below when reviewing the claims folder and/or implementing the Board’s decision.

| **If the Board’s**<br>**decision…** | **Then…** |

| ### **7.G.1.f. Ensuring the Appellant Received the Decision** |  | When reviewing folders returned by the Board, ensure that the Board’s decision was mailed to the appellant’s current address.<br>If the decision was _not_ mailed to the appellant’s current address<br>- mail a printed or photocopy of the decision to the most recent address of record<br>  <br>- update the appellant’s new address in<br>  <br>  - the Veterans Appeals Control and Locator System (VACOLS)<br>  - the Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS), or<br>  - Share<br>- annotate the decision with the new address and the date it was remailed; however,<br>  <br>- do _not_, under any circumstances, change the date stamped on the first page of the decision.<br>  <br>**_References_**:  For more information on<br>- annotating a document in VBMS, see the [_VBMS User Guide_](https://vbaw.vba.va.gov/VBMS/Resources_Technical_Information.asp), and<br>  <br>- updating an address in VBMS, see [M21-1, Part II, Subpart iii, 3.B.1.b](https://vaww.vrm.km.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_kanew/help/agent/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001034/content/554400000174882/M21-1-Part-II-Subpart-iii-Chapter-3-Section-B-System-Updates-at-Intake#1), and<br>  <br>- updating an address in VACOLS, see the _[VACOLS User Guide, Part 2](https://vbaw.vba.va.gov/bl/21/publicat/Users/VACOLS/part2.pdf)_. |

| ### ****7.G.1.g**. Determining the Effective Date for a Grant of Benefits by the Board** |  | When a Board grant does not prescribe a specific disability evaluation and/or effective date, the RO or DROC must review the appeal record and take jurisdiction of these downstream issues.

To determine the effective date for a grant of benefits by the Board, take the steps in the following table.

**_Note_**:  Use the VBMS-Rating (VBMS-R) embedded Effective Date Builder tool based on the effective dates rules in [38 CFR 3.400](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=bfecb95dfc470c065e85741c5dfd1141&node=se38.1.3_1400&rgn=div8).

| **Step** | **Action** |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Determine the period of entitlement covered by the Board decision and assign the appropriate effective date, typically the later of the<br>- date of claim, or<br>  <br>- date entitlement arose.<br>  <br>**_Note_**:  While the above represents the general rule, decision makers must determine whether any other effective date rules apply to the facts of the case. |
| 2 | Review available medical and lay evidence relevant to level of disability or other benefit entitlement requirements, from the effective date to present. |
| 3 | - Consider the applicable evaluation criteria for the issue.<br>  <br>- Stage the rating appropriately by assigning one or more disability evaluations (or other ancillary entitlement(s)) based on the facts gathered in Step 2 for the period from the effective date (identified in Step 1) to present.<br>  <br>**_Reference_**:  For more information on staged ratings, see [Fenderson v. West](http://vaww.vrm.km.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_kanew/help/agent/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001034/content/554400000073346/Fenderson-v-West-Jan-20-1999-12-VetApp-119-1999), 12 Vet.App. 119 (1999). |

| ### ****7.G.1.i**. Subsequently Raised IU** |  | The Board may determine the issue of entitlement to total disability based on individual unemployability (IU) has been reasonably raised by the record and remand the case back to VBA or grant entitlement to IU.

If the Board determines that entitlement to IU has been reasonably raised by the record and issues a decision remanding or granting IU, then complete all development actions and use the table below to document the decision on IU.

| **If entitlement to IU is...** | **Then...** |
| --- | --- |
| remanded | - conduct all necessary development for entitlement to IU, including a request for [_VA Form 21-8940_, _Veteran's Application for Increased Compensation of Disability Based on Unemployability_](https://vbaw.vba.va.gov/bl/20/cio/20s5/forms/VBA-21-8940-ARE.pdf).<br>  <br>- when development is complete, make a decision on the issue of IU in a rating decision and provide notification to the Veteran. |
| granted | - review the file to determine if the _[VA Form 21-8940](https://vbaw.vba.va.gov/bl/20/cio/20s5/forms/VBA-21-8940-ARE.pdf)_, is already in evidence. If no, develop for a _[VA Form 21-8940](https://vbaw.vba.va.gov/bl/20/cio/20s5/forms/VBA-21-8940-ARE.pdf)_.<br>  <br>- if _[VA Form 21-8940](https://vbaw.vba.va.gov/bl/20/cio/20s5/forms/VBA-21-8940-ARE.pdf)_ is in evidence or upon completion of development, implement the Board's grant of IU in a rating decision and provide notification to the Veteran.<br>  <br>_**Note**:_ If the Veteran fails to complete and return _[VA Form 21-8940](https://vbaw.vba.va.gov/bl/20/cio/20s5/forms/VBA-21-8940-ARE.pdf)_, and the evidence of record shows the Veteran is currently employed, send the remand and attach the evidence of employment to OAR Quality and Training at [VBAWASOARQUALITYTRN@va.gov](mailto:vbawasoarqualitytrn@va.gov). OAR will review the remand and evidence and submit to the Board if necessary.<br>If the Veteran fails to complete and return _[VA Form 21-8940](http://vbaw.vba.va.gov/bl/20/cio/20s5/forms/VBA-21-8940-ARE.pdf)_ and there is no evidence of record showing employment, implement the Board's decision granting entitlement to IU in a rating decision, assigning the applicable effective date based on the available evidence of record. |

| ### ****7.G.1.j**.  Processing Board Requests for Quality Assurance Records** |  | When a remand decision requires the RO or DROC to obtain quality assurance documents, the RO or DROC must complete reasonable efforts to request from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) any quality assurance records or documents that are relevant to the claim.

If needed, request the appellant provide sufficient information to help locate documents or records from VHA.  All efforts to secure the records must be documented and associated with the claims record.

If VHA denies access to the documents on the basis that they are protected by Section [38 U.S.C. 5705(a),](https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/USCODE-2010-title38/USCODE-2010-title38-partIV-chap57-subchapI-sec5705) appeal VHA’s denial to the Office of General Counsel (OGC) under [38 CFR 17.506](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=1ca200dcb0946b0c6b05f16f1e781ab1&mc=true&node=se38.1.17_1506&rgn=div8) within 60 days of the denial.

| ### ****7.G.2.f.  Handling Documents Disagreeing With Board Decisions**** |  | Although the Board provides clear instructions to appellants on how to file a document disagreeing with a Board decision, appellants often send these types of documents to VBA instead of the Board.

The table below shows the steps involved in handling documents that disagree with Board decisions.

| **Step** | **Action** |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | A claims processor<br>- reviews the possible MFR to ensure it is date-stamped, and<br>  <br>- hand carries the document with its corresponding claims and/or temporary folders (if available) to a Coach or designee for review.<br>  <br>**_Note_**:  If the possible MFR is associated with an electronic claims<br>folder (eFolder), the claims processor must annotate the document<br>in VBMS and notify the Coach or designee.<br>**_Reference_**:  For more information on annotating a document in VBMS, see the _[VBMS User Guide](https://vbaw.vba.va.gov/VBMS/Resources_Technical_Information.asp)._ |
| 2 | The Coach or designee reviews VACOLS to determine the action needed. Use the table below to determine the next appropriate action.

| **If the Board has …** | **Then …** |
| --- | --- |
| rendered a final decision on any appeal | go to Step 3. |
| never rendered a decision on any appeal, _but_ there is an appeal pending | go to Step 4. |

**_Note_**:  If neither of the above applies, the Coach will route the document and claims folder to the next appropriate activity. |
| 3 | If the Board has rendered a final decision on any appeal, the claims processor

- prepares the _Disagreement with BVA Decision_ letter from the [Letter Creator](http://vbacodmoint1.vba.va.gov/bl/21/LetterGenerator/LG.asp), or equivalent letter from the Personal Computer Generated Letters (PCGL)

- associates a copy of the letter in the claims folder or temporary folder, as appropriate

- mails the letter to the appellant and representative, if any, and

- uses the table below to process the correspondence.


| **If the claims folder is…** | **Then the claims processor…** |
| --- | --- |
| paperless | - annotates the correspondence in VBMS, and<br>  <br>- routes the mail to the Board queue in the Centralized Mail Portal. |
| paper | - photocopies the correspondence, and<br>  <br>- mails the original date-stamped document, if available, to the Board at <br>  <br>Board of Veterans’ Appeals<br>P.O. Box 27063<br>Washington, DC 20038<br>**_Important_**:<br>- ROs and DROCs should mail documents pending transmission to the Board on a weekly basis.<br>  <br>- Upon receipt of the documents, the Board will review the documents to determine the next appropriate action. |

**_References_**:  For more information on

| 4 | If the Board has never rendered a decision on any appeal, but there is an appeal pending, the claims processor

- reviews the submitted document for necessary action

- telephones or otherwise contacts the appellant and/or the appellant’s representative and asks for any necessary clarification

- routes claims, evidence, or arguments concerning issues not currently on appeal to the next appropriate activity, and

- follows the table below to process the correspondence.


| **If the appeal is pending with…** | **Then the claims processor forwards the correspondence to…** |

| ### ****7.G.3.a.  DROC Role With Remands**** |  | The Decision Review Operations Centers have complete authority to develop remands, reach decisions based on additional evidence gathered, and authorize the payment of benefits. If the DROC is unable to grant an appeal in full, it returns the appeal to the Board for continuation of the appellate process. |

| ### ****7.G.3.b.DROC**** ****Jurisdiction**** |  | If the Board determines a remand is in order, they will send the remand directly to a DROC for additional processing.  However, in some cases, the remand must be sent to the RO for processing.  The DROC will not process a remand if it involves any of the following issues:<br>- remands requiring formal, in-person DRO hearings where remote DROC resources are unavailable near the regional office of jurisdiction and Veteran has opted to not have a virtual hearing<br>  <br>- Committee on Waivers and Compromises (upon completion of the validity of debt determination by the DROC)<br>  <br>- spina bifida claims requiring specialized development by the Denver RO<br>  <br>- Mustard gas claims requiring specialized development by the Muskogee RO<br>  <br>- Service connection based on C-123 aircraft claims requiring specialized development at St. Paul RO<br>  <br>- Forfeiture cases requiring specialized development at the St. Paul RACC<br>  <br>- Filipino Veterans Equity Compensation (FVEC) by the Manila RO<br>  <br>- incompetency issues (the DROC will complete all decisions pertinent to the issues on appeal and the final rating of incompetency, at which point, the file will be returned to the RO or the Salt Lake Fiduciary Hub, as appropriate, to process [_VA Form 21-592, Request for Appointment of a Fiduciary, Custodian or Guardian_](http://vbaw.vba.va.gov/bl/20/cio/20s5/forms/VBA-21-592-ARE.pdf).<br>  <br>- issues involving VBA business lines other than Compensation Service and Pension and Fiduciary Service (such as Veterans' Readiness and Employment, Education, Insurance, and Loan Guaranty)<br>  <br>Upon identification by the DROC,  remands that involve one of these types of appeals will be returned to the appropriate RO for processing.

| ### ****7.G.3.c. Requirements for Expeditious Processing of Remands**** |  | Remands are among the oldest cases and must be worked on a priority basis. _[PL 103-446, Veterans Benefits Improvement Act of 1994](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-108/pdf/STATUTE-108-Pg4645.pdf)_, mandates that remands be given special attention and expeditious processing.<br>**_Important_**:  CAVC may impose sanctions if it is determined that VA did not make a reasonable effort to expeditiously comply with the remands.<br>**_References_**:  For more information on<br>- the definition of a remand, see [M21-5 Chapter 7, Section A, 1.m](https://vaww.vrm.km.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_kanew/help/agent/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001034/content/554400000140915/M21-5-Chapter-7-Section-A-General-Information-on-Legacy-Appeals), and<br>  <br>- expediting remands, see [_Harvey v.

| ### ****7.G.3.d. Who Is Responsible for Timely Processing**** |  | RO and DROC management are responsible for timely processing of Board remands. |

* * *

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ### ****7.G.3.e. Processing the Remand**** |  | Upon receipt of a Board remand the<br>- claims folder is assigned to the Decision Review Officer (DRO), RO management staff member, or designee, and<br>  <br>- the designee ensures that<br>  <br>  - development of the remand is initiated within 15 days from the date of receipt, and<br>  - VACOLS is updated within seven days, and<br>  - VBMS 070 series end product (EP) is established with an appropriate claim label as discussed in [M21-4, Appendix B](https://vaww.vrm.km.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_kanew/help/agent/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001034/content/554400000011474/Appendix%20B.%20End%20Product%20Codes).<br>Upon receipt of the requested evidence or after a reasonable effort to obtain evidence, the designee<br>- prepares a new decision or SSOC, and<br>  <br>- returns the case to the Board after expiration of the 30-day response period.<br>  <br>**_Note_**:  The EP 070 must not be cleared until the legacy remand has been recertified to the Board or the full benefit sought on appeal is granted by VBA. <br>**_Reference_**:  For more information on the use of EP 070s, see [M21-4, Appendix B](https://vaww.vrm.km.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_kanew/help/agent/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001034/content/554400000011474/Appendix%20B.%20End%20Product%20Codes). |

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ### ****7.G.3.f. _Manlincon_ Remands**** |  | If, during the review of an appeal, the Board discovers a timely notice of disagreement (NOD) filed on another issue, but an SOC is not issued by the RO, the Board must remand, not refer, the NOD issue to the RO or DROC for issuance of an SOC.<br>ROs and DROCs must handle _Manlincon_ remands in the same expeditious manner as all other remands. <br>**_Important_**:  Once the RO or DROC issues an SOC on the _Manlincon_ remand, the appellant must submit a timely [_VA Form 9, Appeal to Board of Veterans' Appeals_](http://vaww.va.gov/vaforms/va/pdf/VA9.pdf), to continue the appeal process.<br>**_References_**:  For more information on<br>- _Manlincon_ remands, see [_Manlincon v. West_](https://vaww.vrm.km.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_kanew/help/agent/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001034/content/554400000087103/Manlincon-v-West-Mar-12-1999-12-VetApp-238-1999?query=manlincon), 12 Vet. App. 238 (1999), and<br>  <br>- preparing and issuing an SOC, see [M21-5, Chapter 7, Section D](https://vaww.vrm.km.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_kanew/help/agent/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001034/content/554400000140652/M21-5-Chapter-7-Section-D-Documenting-Appeal-Decisions). |

* * *

| ### ****7.G.3.g. _Stegall_ Remands**** |  | VA must ensure compliance with the terms and conditions set forth in remand orders from both the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims and the Board of Veterans’ Appeals.  See _Stegall v. West_, 11 Vet. App. 268 (1998).  When the RO or DROC fails to comply with multiple remand orders before an appeal is recertified to the Board, the appeal is remanded back to VBA for action and such cases are designated in VACOLS as _Stegall_.

To prevent further delays in processing, when a _Stegall_ remand is ready for recertification to the Board, a DRO must review the appeal, certify compliance with all remand directives and complete all required actions to issue a new decision and if applicable, recertify the appeal to the Board.

DROs must follow the steps in the table below once development is complete on a _Stegall_ remand.

| **Step** | **Action** |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Review all development actions. |
| 2 | Were all remand directives followed and fully completed?<br>- If _yes_,<br>  <br>- Complete certification requirement by adding the following language as a permanent note in VBMS and:<br>_I certify that I reviewed Board decision dated MM/DD/YYYY and all remand directives were followed to the fullest extent possible._<br>- Issue the new decision and recertify the appeal back to the Board, if applicable.<br>  <br>- If _no_,<br>  <br>- If development instructions appeared improper or VBA had to otherwise deviate from the Board’s instructions, prepare a memorandum detailing the facts and circumstances to inform subsequent reviewers why VBA took alternate action, or<br>- Complete a deferral with required actions and enter a permanent note in VBMS. |

**_Reference:_**  For more information on preparing memoranda to explain deviations from Board remands, see [M21-5, Chapter 7, Section G, 4.a](https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018/content/554400000140917/M21-5-Chapter-7-Section-G-Board-of-Veterans-Appeals-Board-Decisions-and-Remands#4a). |

| ### **7.G.4.a. Developing Evidence in Remands** |  | Follow the Board’s detailed directives when developing evidence for a remand by ensuring all required actions are taken in compliance with the remand.  If any action is not undertaken, or is taken in a deficient manner, appropriate corrective action is required.  <br>If a deviation from the Board directives is required, the claims processor must prepare a memorandum detailing the facts and circumstances to inform the subsequent reviewers why alternate action was taken (refer to the [_Deviation from Board Remand Directives Memorandum_ template](https://vbaw.vba.va.gov/OAR/docs/deviation-from-board-remand-directives-memorandum-template-v2.docx)). The memorandum is necessary to explain the use of different methods for obtaining the Board's intended result. Requests for clarification of the Board's directives should be routed through the local Quality Review Team (QRT) for guidance. If unable to provide clarification locally, DROC QRT management may submit inquiries through the [VBA Feedback Loop](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/sites/VBAAMOSharePoint/APA/Quality/SiteAssets/oarReviewReq/pendingOARField.aspx?web=1&xsdata=MDV8MDJ8fDc4NjRhNWVjMDhkMDRjNzMzNzk5MDhkY2NjMmVmNGJlfGU5NWYxYjIzYWJhZjQ1ZWU4MjFkYjdhYjI1MWFiM2JmfDB8MHw2Mzg2MDk3NDkyNjE1NzEwMTV8VW5rbm93bnxUV0ZwYkdac2IzZDhleUpXSWpvaU1DNHdMakF3TURBaUxDSlFJam9pVjJsdU16SWlMQ0pCVGlJNklrMWhhV3dpTENKWFZDSTZNbjA9fDB8fHw%3d&sdata=ZXcwcDBvUjJBRU9EM0tZQTFZK05HeXJJL1FKMFBHZmxhdHVBTHJDZ1VHST0%3d&clickparams=eyAiWC1BcHBOYW1lIiA6ICJNaWNyb3NvZnQgT3V0bG9vayIsICJYLUFwcFZlcnNpb24iIDogIjE2LjAuMTczMjguMjA1NTAiLCAiT1MiIDogIldpbmRvd3MiIH0%3d&SafelinksUrl=https%3a%2f%2fdvagov.sharepoint.com%2fsites%2fVBAAMOSharePoint%2fAPA%2fQuality%2fSiteAssets%2foarReviewReq%2fpendingOARField.aspx&SafelinksUrl=https%3a%2f%2fdvagov.sharepoint.com%2fsites%2fVBAAMOSharePoint%2fAPA%2fQuality%2fSiteAssets%2foarReviewReq%2fpendingOARField.aspx) SharePoint site. Management from non-DROC offices may send inquiries to OAR Quality & Training at [VBAWASOARQUALITYTRN@va.gov](mailto:VAVBAWASOARQUALITYTRN@va.gov). <br>When a Board remand instructs VBA to obtain additional records (for example, military records such as deck logs, unit records, or exposure-related records) claims processors must follow all Board directives and document their efforts in accordance with 38 U.S.C. 5103A. If any action cannot be completed as directed, the claims processor must use the existing [_Deviation from Board Remand Directives Memorandum_ template](http://vbaw.vba.va.gov/OAR/docs/deviation-from-board-remand-directives-memorandum-template-v2.docx) to explain the reason for deviation and detail all development actions taken to achieve the Board's intended result.<br>Development actions may include, but are not limited to:<br>- Requests to record repositories (e.g., National Archives, Records Acquisition & Research (RAR), or DPRIS)<br>- Follow-ups and responses from official sources<br>- Alternative searches for military records such as unit records, deck logs, or exposure records<br>- Communications with DoD or other federal agencies regarding record availability<br>- Confirmation that all available records have been associated with the claims file or that VBA issued a formal finding of unavailability.<br>The memorandum should certify that all reasonable efforts have been exhausted, and no further development is possible. This approach ensures consistency, compliance with statutory requirements, and proper documentation of all actions taken to satisfy the Board's directive.<br>**_Example_**:  Veteran is seeking SC for an injury that occurred during a period of unverified service in 2020. The remand directs VBA to contact the Records Management Center to verify the Veteran’s service.<br>Since the Board directive would not fulfill the intent of the remand (the records for a period of service in 2020 may be retrieved from DPRIS, not RMC), the claims processor should detail the facts of why the remand directives were not followed and contact the proper records custodian. |

| ### **7.G.4.** b. Determining Adequate Examinations |  | The Board is not required to remand an appealed disability benefit claim solely because time has elapsed since an adequate examination report was obtained. <br>An examination deemed adequate for the purposes of determining a claim by the RO (or DROC) will ordinarily be adequate for the Board.<br>The Board may request an additional examination when the claimant asserts that the disability in question has undergone an increase in severity since the last examination.<br>**_Reference_**: For more information on reviewing examination reports for adequacy, see [M21-1, Part IV, Subpart i, 3.A.1.a.](https://vaww.vrm.km.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_kanew/help/agent/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001034/content/554400000180514/M21-1-Part-IV-Subpart-i-Chapter-3-Section-A-General-Criteria-for-Sufficiency-of-Examination-Reports) |

* * *

| ### ****7.G.4.c. Requesting Examinations for Remands**** |  | In some situations, the remand requires some type of examination or other efforts from the VHA or a contract examiner. While remand instructions may dictate that a specific type of medical professional conduct the examination, the Board recognizes that such specialists are not always available for VA purposes (for example, rural areas or claimants with a foreign address), and therefore will accept a medical examination from an appropriate examiner as long as VBA has made reasonable efforts to obtain an exam/opinion from a specialist and the examiner indicates the appropriate knowledge base and/or skill set to complete the exam or render the requested opinion.

Follow the steps in the table below to request an examination for a remand.

| **Step** | **Action** |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Request the examination in the normal manner, identifying the case as a Board remand.<br>**_Note_**:  The examination request should be stated in neutral, objective terms, without implying the expected result of the examination. When necessary, use the exact remand language (copy and paste) for examination language specifically requested by the Board.<br>**_Reference_**:  For more information on examination request procedures, see [M21-1, Part IV, Subpart i, 2.A.1](https://vaww.vrm.km.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_kanew/help/agent/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001034/content/554400000180498/M21-1-Part-IV-Subpart-i-Chapter-2-Section-A-Examination-Requests-Overview#1). |
| 2 | The Board requires the examiner to review the claims folder in conjunction with an examination.  Request the examiner to review <br>- a copy of the remand special examination instructions, and<br>- all documents in VBMS.<br>**_Note_**: Relevant evidence in the claims folder must be tabbed or annotated for the examiner’s attention in accordance with [M21-1, Part IV, Subpart i, 2.A.8.d](https://vaww.vrm.km.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_kanew/help/agent/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001034/content/554400000180498/M21-1-Part-IV-Subpart-i-Chapter-2-Section-A-Examination-Requests-Overview#8d). |

When a specific type of medical professional is not available to conduct the C&P examination and/or medical opinion for VA purposes (for example, rural areas or claimants with a foreign address) as directed by the Board, prepare a memorandum for the Veteran's file documenting all efforts taken to obtain an examination specialist and explain why the specialist could not be obtained. If VHA or a contract examiner state that another qualified medical professional is available to complete the examination and/or medical opinion instead, document this response within the memorandum. The memorandum should include:

- date(s) of request(s) for the examination specialist,
- response from VHA or a contract examiner confirming an examination specialist is not available to conduct the C&P examination and/or medical opinion for VA purposes,
- justification from VHA or a contract examiner for why an examination specialist is not available to conduct the C&P examination and/or medical opinion for VA purposes (for example, rural areas or claimants with a foreign address), and
- confirmation from VHA or a contract examiner that another qualified medical professional is available to complete the examination and/or medical opinion for VA purposes instead.

| ### ****7.G.4.d.  Routing the Claims Folder for an Independent Medical Opinion**** |  | In some situations, a specialist at a medical school will need to review the claims folder received from the Board to conduct an independent medical examination.<br>In this situation, a representative from a VA facility will personally deliver and pick up the claims folder from the medical school.<br>**_Notes_**:  <br>- If the claims folder exists in an electronic database, the VA facility must print the documents to provide to the specialist.  <br>  <br>- The Board may temporarily remove a Board medical advisor’s opinion, prior to forwarding the claims folder to the independent medical expert.  Such action would not violate [38 U.S.C. 7104 (a).](https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/USCODE-2009-title38/USCODE-2009-title38-partV-chap71-sec7104)<br>  <br>_**Reference**_: For more information on requesting an independent medical opinion, please see [M21-1, Part IV, Subpart i, 2.E.5.a](https://vaww.vrm.km.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_kanew/help/agent/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001034/content/554400000180507/M21-1-Part-IV-Subpart-i-Chapter-2-Section-E-Examinations-in-Special-Situations#5) and [38 CFR 3.328](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=ad275643432556b9dda942343fb89296&mc=true&node=pt38.1.3&rgn=div58#se38.1.3_1328). |

Referring Remands for Rating or Authorization Activity**** |  | Refer the remand to the appeals rating or authorization activity when<br>- all evidence is received, <br>- VA has fulfilled its obligations to attempt to obtain that evidence, or<br>- the suspense date has matured, and no additional action is warranted. |

* * *

| ### ****7.G.4.f. Reviewing Additional Evidence and Development Actions for the Remand**** |  | Follow the steps in the table below when reviewing additional evidence or development action(s) for the remand.

| **Step** | **Action** |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Did VA receive the requested evidence?<br>- If _yes_,<br>  <br>  - carefully review the entire record, and<br>  - go to Step 2.<br>- If _no_, follow the procedures in [M21-5, Chapter 7, Section G, 4.g](https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018/content/554400000140917/M21-5-Chapter-7-Section-G-Board-of-Veterans-Appeals-Board-Decisions-and-Remands#4g). |
| 2 | - If any benefit(s) sought on appeal can be awarded<br>  <br>  - issue a rating decision on the awarded benefit(s)<br>    <br>  - update VACOLS to reflect the issue(s) granted, and<br>    <br>  - route the claim to the authorization activity.<br>- If any issue remains denied, go to Step 3 _._ |
| 3 | If one or more benefit remains denied<br>- issue an SSOC<br>  <br>- update VACOLS with the SSOC date<br>  <br>- **DROC Appeals Processors:** add the _AMC NOD brokering project_ special issue in VBMS - do not add the _SSOC Issued - Awaiting Certification to the Board_ tracked item<br>  <br>- **Regional Office Special Mission Legacy Appeals Processors:** update VBMS with _SSOC Issued - Awaiting Certification to the Board_ tracked item<br>  <br>- create a VACOLS diary with a 30-day suspense, and<br>  <br>- go to Step 4. <br>  <br>**_Reference_**: For more information on preparing and issuing an SSOC, see [M21-5, Chapter 7, Section D, 4](https://vaww.vrm.km.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_kanew/help/agent/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001034/content/554400000140652/M21-5-Chapter-7-Section-D-Documenting-Appeal-Decisions#4). |
| 4 | After waiting 30 days for the appellant to respond to the SSOC, close the _SSOC Issued - Awaiting Certification to the Board_ tracked item (if applicable). Did VA receive any relevant evidence that was not previously considered?<br>- If _yes_, but now additional development is required<br>  <br>  - take appropriate action to obtain additional evidence, and<br>  - return to Step 2.<br>- If _yes,_ but the benefit still cannot be granted, go to Step 3.<br>  <br>- If _no_, return the remand to the Board as instructed in [M21-5, Chapter 7, Section G, 4.g](https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018/content/554400000140917/M21-5-Chapter-7-Section-G-Board-of-Veterans-Appeals-Board-Decisions-and-Remands#4g). |

**_Note_**: After the RO or DROC renders a decision on the remand, the appellant may submit additional evidence during the SSOC 30-day response period.  The appellant may also submit an SSOC waiver that waives the right to have VA wait a minimum of 30 days before returning the appeal to the Board for final disposition. Additionally, the appellant may opt into the modernized review system within 60 days of the issuance of the SOC/SSOC. See [M21-5, Chapter 4, Topic 3](https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018/content/554400000141022/M21-5-Chapter-4-Appeals-Modernization-Act-AMA-Control-and-Other-Activities).
