Compensation for disabilities caused, disabilities made worse, or death as a result of the carelessness, negligence, lack of proper skill, error in judgment, or similar instance of fault on the part of the **Department of Veterans affairs** in furnishing the hospital care, medical or surgical treatment, or examination, or caused by participation in a compensated work therapy program, such as [Veteran Readiness and Employment](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vre).

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- If you are awarded a judgment against the United States (VA) in a civil action (Federal Tort Claim) due to the VA causing a disability **NO** extra disability benefits will be paid out _until_ the amount paid out to the Veteran via the judgement equals out!

  - Meaning if you got a judgement for $100,000 and your Combined VA disability was 70% and the 1151 conditions bumped you to 90%; you would **NOT** get the increased rate of pay of the 90% (you’d keep getting the 70%) - till the VA withheld $100,000 worth of money.

    - If for instance you got increases or got additional things service-connected and your combined without the 1151 conditions combined to 90%, then you’d get the 90% rate as normal. If with the 1151 conditions you were put at 100% then again, VA would again withhold the difference of the pay rates.
  - Similarly, if [Auto](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/auto) or [DIC](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/survivorbenefits#dic) benefits are award with the basis being a 1151 condition then VA would withhold the payments till caught up.

  - VA [Pension](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/pension) and [Survivors pension](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/survivorbenefits#pension) do **NOT** feature withholding; **BUT** the award amount itself would count against net worth calculations (if money is still on hand).
- If you were previously denied service-connection for a condition and are now claiming that condition under 1151 (or vice versa), do **NOT** file an [Appeal](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals)! As a claim under 1151 is **NOT** a claim for service-connection!

  - However, if you were denied under 1151 and are again filing under 1151 for the condition, you **WOULD** need to file an appeal!
- Grants under 1151 do **NOT** establish service-connection! Grants instead establish compensation as if the condition _was_ service-connected.

- Treatment under [Community Care](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/commcare) does **NOT** qualify for 1151 grants _or_ federal torts!


## **Winning a Federal Tort Claim**

In order to win the claim the Veteran needs to show:

1. Injured by a federal government employee;

2. The employee was acting within the scope of his or her official duties;

3. The employee was acting negligently or wrongfully; and

4. The negligent or wrongful act proximately caused the injury of which he or she complains.


To submit a claim you or your legal representative can complete a [Standard Form 95](https://www.gsa.gov/system/files/SF95-07a.pdf) and submit it to:

Mail:

> ```
>   Department of Veterans Affairs
>   Office of General Counsel
>   Torts Law Group
>   810 Vermont Avenue, NW
>   Washington, DC 20420
> ```

Email: [ogc.torts@va.gov](mailto:ogc.torts@va.gov)

Fax: (202) 495-5076

It is **HIGHLY** recommended to seek an attorney who specializes in federal tort claims!

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- The claim **MUST** be received within 2 YEARS of the injury!

- Unlike with a 1151 claim, the federal government has **NO** [Duty to Assist](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/dta). Meaning, you will need to do all the leg work and provide and gather the evidence needed to support your own claim!


[Return to top](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/1151#top)

## **Winning a 1151 Claim**

In order to win the claim the Veteran's claim needs to contain the following 3 elements:

1. An event that meets the below criteria.

2. Disability or death that began or was made worse after element 1 occurred.

3. A [Nexus letter/independent medical opinion](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/imo) that finds element 1 caused element 2.


There is no special or separate form to file a 1151 claim. The Veteran simply needs to identify it as being a 1151 claim when filing their [Claim](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vaclaim).

To assist the VA in obtaining relevant records you need to identify:

- Where the event occurred in;

- Approximately when the event occurred; and

- Explain how the provider messed up.


**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- If a grant is based on aggravation then the condition will be evaluated under the formulation shown [HERE](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/agg#rating) in the pre-service example.


[Return to top](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/1151#top)

## **Detailed Explanation of Criteria**

Compensation can be paid for disabilities that result from, are aggravated beyond their natural progression, or cause death due to:

- Acts of omission;

  - Failure to obtain **INFORMED** consent **PRIOR** to treatment;

  - Failure to provide a _timely_ diagnosis or treatment for a disability.
- Compensated work therapy program, such as [Veteran Readiness and Employment](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vre);

  - Disability or death caused by direct participation in the program.

    - Meaning if you get hurt/sick while just being in a program (at large), is **NOT** enough! The disability **MUST** be a result of doing something required to complete the program. So for instance getting hurt due to falling down the stairs at home while you are in a program would **NOT** be covered.
- Error in judgment;

  - Errors involving _negligence_. This does **NOT** include errors that are the result of a misdiagnosis/treatment that are later found to be incorrect. Meaning, doctors are human and medicine is not always an exact science so not every error is due to negligence!
- Examinations;

- Failure to diagnose or treat;

  - A determination that a physician exercising proper skill and care required by their profession would have reasonably been able to diagnose the condition and provide treatment. The VA **WILL** get a third party to provide a medical opinion on this matter if necessary.

    - This failure **MUST** have resulted in disability or death that would have probably been avoided had a proper diagnosis and treatment been given.
- Failure to follow the established standard of care;

  - When the standard of care is not followed due to things like carelessness, negligence, lack of skill, etc.
- Medication;

  - Disability caused by the prescribing of the wrong dosage/medication.
- Premature discharge.

  - Disability was caused by or aggravated beyond its natural progression due to being released too soon.

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- If a disability is due to another patient (non-staff) while **NOT** under care/examination, the disability is **NOT** eligible for compensation under 1151!

- If a disability is the result of the Veteran failing to follow medical instructions and this conclusion can be reasonably supported then a **DENIAL** is warranted!

- If a disability or death is found to be the typical or natural progression of a disease of injury then compensation **CANNOT** be awarded.

- Disabilities that are the result of reasonable care/treatment outcomes are **NOT** eligible for compensation (these are typically spelled out before consent for treatment is given).

## **Effective Dates**

[Effective dates](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/edate) for 1151 grants have additional considerations than typical claims:

- Compensation is either:

  - Date of the injury or aggravation, if the claim is received within _one year_ of the incident; or

  - Date of claim was initiated.
- [DIC](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/survivorbenefits#dic) is either the:

  - First day of the month in which the Veteran’s death occurred, if a claim is received within _one year_ following the date of death; or

  - Date claim was received.

## **Ancillary Benefits (Additional Benefits)**

Veterans who are granted compensation under 1151 _may_ be eligible for additional benefits such as:

- [Automobile/Adaptive equipment](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/auto);

- [Clothing allowance](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/cloth); and/or

- [Specially adaptive housing/Special housing adaptation](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/housing#sah).


[Return to top](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/1151#top)

## **Forbidden Ancillary Benefits**

The following benefits **CANNOT** be based on any disabilities which have been granted via 1151! If the Veteran establishes eligibility for these benefits outside of 1151 grants then they will get them!

- 10-point Civil Service Preference;

- [Life insurance](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/life-insurance) (cannot apply based on a grant of 1151);

- [CHAMPVA](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/champva);

- Chapter 31 education benefits;

- [Chapter 35 (DEA)](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/survivorbenefits#dea) benefits;

- Loan guaranty (surviving spouses);

- Waiver of loan guaranty fee.

## **Frequently** **Asked Questions**

- #### 1151 claims cover what again?






1151 claims cover:



- Aggravation of pre-existing conditions;

- New disabilities; and

- Deaths.


Caused by VA care and compensated work therapy program (in the circumstances mentioned above).

- #### What is informed consent?






- Agreement by the Veteran or their surrogate about a treatment **AFTER** information about the treatment has been provided to the veteran and they have been given the opportunity to ask questions.


**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- If there is an **EMERGENCY** situation in which consent **CANNOT** be obtained due to immediate care needs, then consent does **NOT** need to be obtained!

  - You arrive in the ER and cannot respond by speech or other means. And waiting for any possible surrogate to response would likely result in death or permanent/worsening disability.

- #### Can I file a 1151 claim for care done outside a VA Medical Center (VAMC)?






It depends…



- **YES** if:

  - The VA referred you to a non-VA facility who conducted the referred procedure;

  - If not for the VA referral the Veteran would not have suffered disability/death; **AND**

  - VAs carelessness, negligence, lack of proper skill, error in judgement, resulted in disability/death.

- #### Can I claim conditions as secondary to a condition that was granted under 1151?






- Yes, you can claim conditions that developed or were aggravated by your 1151 granted condition.


- #### Isn't it a major conflict of interest to have the VA do their own exams? Wouldn't they try to hide their dirty laundry?






- 1151 claims are expressly prohibited to have exams conducted by VA staff conduct the examinations. Which is why all exams/opinions will be done by a 3rd party contractor.

  - If you still feel iffy you can always provide your own properly credentialed medical opinion/examination at your own cost.
