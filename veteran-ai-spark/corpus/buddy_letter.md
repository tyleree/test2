Are your military records missing evidence or context?

If so, the VA provides you with two options:

1. Buddy letters; and

2. [Personal statements](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/personal).


If you know someone who can attest to something you were a part of, witness to, changes in your behavior, and/or the severity of your symptoms then having them write a buddy statement can be a useful piece of evidence for your claim.

However, if you yourself want to write a statement in support of your own claim click [HERE](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/personal).

* * *

## **Who Can Write a Buddy Letter/Statement?**

There are four groups of people who can write buddy letters in support of your claim:

1. Someone who served with you.

2. Your friends and family.

3. Civilian coworkers/supervisors.

4. Anyone else: your parole officer, priest, etc.


## **Writing Tips**

- Use the proper VA form! [VA Form 21-10210](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-21-10210-ARE.pdf) is the latest and greatest form they should use.

- Keep it brief and to the point, remember BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front). The rater doesn't have time to get lost in a great story about the time Pvt. Reddit put LT's patrol cap in the freezer, after filling it with water. (But the people at [r/Veterans](https://www.reddit.com/r/Veterans) do.)

- Quantify (state numbers) when possible. Which sounds better?:

1. Veteran's headaches are so severe s(he) has to lay down for most of the day. These headaches occur _fairly frequently_; **OR**

2. Veteran's headaches are so severe s(he) has to lay down for most of the day. These headaches occur at _least three times a week_.
- Unless your buddy is a licensed physician in the relevant area of medicine, they should **NOT** try to diagnosis the Veteran. Remember, have them stick to the facts of their _direct_ observations! But if your buddy _does just so happen to be a licensed physician in the relevant area of medicine_. Have them complete a [Disability Benefit Questionnaires (DBQs)](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/dbq) and/or an [Independent Medical Opinion (IMO)/Nexus Letter](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/imo).


**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- Do **NOT** tell your buddy _what_ to write!! They must write what they **SAW** in relation to you and your claim. So if they did _not_ witness anything or they recall something differently.... Well that's that!

- Again… the buddy can **ONLY** write about something they have first-hand experience (they saw you get hurt, remember you having issues, seen you have current issues, etc.). They **CANNOT** write about something they heard or learned about second hand (even if the person they heard something from is now dead).

  - Hearsay itself does not help prove anything. So a statement of ““X told me Buddy had been involved in a vehicle accident and was given a cast.” Provides **NO** value to a claim/appeal.
- But **DO** tell them _how_ to write the letter.

- If your buddy for whatever reason does not want to use the VA form. Ensure that they write "I CERTIFY THAT I have completed this statement and that its information is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief." Directly above where they sign and date their letter. In addition to providing their contact information.

## **What Should be in the Letter**

It depends on the your purpose you are trying to accomplish:

- Help prove service-connection:

1. How you know the Veteran and for how long you've known them. (If you served in the military together, providing information such as your unit(s) and dates you served together will help strengthen your statement by providing more credibility.)

2. Details about the in-service event that caused the injury or illness.

3. How the Veteran was impacted by the event. Any changes in physical/mental health?
- Help prove severity of your disability:

1. How you know the Veteran and for how long you've known them.

2. What are the Veteran’s current symptoms? How do their disabilit(ies) interfere with their job, social life, things they can no longer do, etc.

### Example 1 (Witnessed an Event)

My name is \[Buddy\], and I served together with Sgt. Reddit in B Co XXX at Ft. Camp from September 20XX to July 20XX. During that time I was Sgt. Reddit's Plt leader.

Sgt. Reddit was an all around good soldier for most of that time. That was until April 20XX when she started having issues, such as showing up late to work, underage drinking, \[etc\]. This resulted in Sgt. Reddit receiving nonjudicial punishment.

It was not until July 20XX that Sgt. Reddit confided in me that she was sexually assaulted by another service member who was from another company.

Upon learning this information I immediately reported the information to the Company Commander. However, I am unaware if that information was acted upon as I separated from the Army shortly thereafter.

* * *

### Example 2 (Witnessed an Event)

My name is \[Buddy\], and I served with Cpl. Reddit for 2 years. During that time I deployed with them to Afghanistan for 1 year. We both served in the same squad.

Prior to our 1 year deployment to Afghanistan in Feb 201X, he was a high achieving soldier who excelled in many areas. He was very outgoing, energetic, and had no discipline problems.

On June 201X, our squad was doing routine patrols when the vehicle immediately...

After that event I noticed that Cpl. Reddit was always on edge, \[other examples of symptoms\].

It is my belief that the events that occurred that day had a lasting negative affect on Cpl. Reddit's mental health.

* * *

### Example 3 (Witnessed an Event)

I served with Sgt. Guy as their platoon leader while we were both assigned to Ft. Bragg in 1991.

In early July 1991, during vehicle maintenance I saw Sgt. Guy get his right hand smashed under a HMMWV hood. I vividly recall his middle and ring fingers swelling and changing colors. While we got him ice, I don’t think he went to medical over it. I eventually left Ft. Bragg in November 1993, I remember Sgt. Guys fingers were still messed up at that time. While his fingers were no longer swollen, they looked bent out of shape and his salutes always looked wrong.

* * *

### Example 4 (Witness to Severity)

I \[Friend\] have known \[Veteran\] for 4 years. We used to get together 3-4 times a month to do activities like walking and bowling. For the past 6 or so months I have noticed a decline in \[Veteran\]'s mobility.

\[Veteran\] is no longer able to walk for as long or as far as they used to. I see that after physical activities that their back becomes very stiff which makes it difficult for them to move around.

It has gotten to the point now that I notice him having difficulties getting into and out of vehicles. This June, when \[Veteran\] was walking back to their car I saw them drop their keys. He attempted to bend down to get them but he was barely able to bend his back. In the end, I had to get his keys for him.

\[Veteran\] has pretty much stopped doing physical activities with me. We maybe go on walks once a month now. Due to their declining physical condition.

## **Frequently** **Asked Questions**

- #### How can I get in touch with people I've served with but lost contact with?






- You can try using sites like:

  - [Together We Served](https://www.togetherweserved.com/)

  - [Facebook - USA Military Directory](https://www.facebook.com/groups/USAMilitaryDirectory/)
- You can also search Facebook to search for specific unit pages as well.

- Hiring a private investigator.

- The VA also offers an interesting mail forwarding option.

  - Click [HERE](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/waldo) for details.

- #### I had my buddy use a 4138 form instead of a VA Form 21-10210. Should I be worried?






- No, but it is always best practice to use the latest and correct forms. However, you should **NOT** fuss about re-sending their statement.


- #### Wait, the form you link says it is expired. Can I still use it?






- The expiration date is more a notice to check to see if there is a newer version out of the form. It **DOES NOT** invalidate the evidence contained on the form itself. That said, the VA (as is often the case) has yet to release a new version of the form. So there is nothing to worry about.


- #### Does both the Veteran and the person who wrote the statement sign block 22A?






- No, only the person who provided the statement.


- #### Who completes Section II?






- Claimant would be the [Spouse or other eligible dependent](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/survivorbenefits#accured) continuing a [Claim](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vaclaim) or [Appeal](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals) for a deceased Veteran.


- #### How do I upload the form to my claim?






- You can upload evidence via this [LINK](https://eauth.va.gov/accessva/?cspSelectFor=quicksubmit).


- #### When I go to upload the form there is no option for VA Form 21-10210?






- You can select the option: Other Correspondence.


- #### Do they need to 'wet sign' the form?






- They can digitally sign the form using a cursive font.


- #### My buddy does not write in English, what are my options?






- They can submit their statement in their native language - the VA **HAS** internal ability to have things translated in-house. However, you may find it beneficial to translate it yourself and just have them sign that version.


- #### The form has an "X" over the signature block!






- This is an issue with the program you are using to view the form; there is not an issue with the form itself. If you print out the form, the "X" will not print. If you are planning on doing the form purely digitally, then you should ensure the program to view the form is up-to-date. If it is, you may need to uninstall/reinstall the program.
