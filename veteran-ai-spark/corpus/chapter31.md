Is a VA program that helps Veterans, Servicemembers, and certain eligible dependents attain employment.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- VR&E is primarily an employment program, **NOT** just a means to get a graduate level degree!


* * *

## **Eligibility**

This program has 3 different eligibility groups.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- To increase readability, only this section of the page will mention the different groups, with the following sections addressing **ALL** groups as ‘Veterans’; unless there is a difference.


* * *

### Veterans

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- If you last separated from Active Duty **BEFORE** January 1, 2013, you _generally_ **MUST** apply within 12 years of separation **_OR_** within 12 years of receiving your _first_ award of service-connection.

  - **HOWEVER**, for those who have this ‘12 year rule’, your eligibility **CAN** be extended/waived based on things like:

    - Medical condition(s) that would have made you unable to complete the program previously (conditions do **NOT** need to be service-connected); or

    - Having a **SERIOUS** employment handicap (conditions do **NOT** need to be service-connected).

      - **SERIOUS** employment handicap means a significant impairment of a veteran's ability to prepare for, obtain, or retain employment consistent with such veteran's abilities, aptitudes, and interest.

Must meet **ALL** of the following requirements:

- Have a service-connected disability of at least 10% (or are [paid at the 10% rate](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/38/3.324));

- **SERIOUS** employment handicap; and

- Received anything other than a dishonorable character of discharge.


* * *

## **Duration of Program**

VR&E may not exceed 48 months of use. **UNLESS**, special conditions are meet.

- Click [HERE](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/38/21.78) for more information.


**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- For Veterans who used their [GI bill](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/gibill) **BEFORE** VR&E, that time **DOES** count against the 48 month limit.

  - **HOWEVER**, that GI bill eligibility (months used) **_CAN_** possibly be restored via [Retroactive induction](https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018/content/554400000143066/M28CVB6-Direct-Reimbursement-and-Retroactive-Induction#a%206.02). Potentially allowing you to use the GI bill again.
- It **IS** possible for someone to use 48 months of VR&E benefits and then separately use 48 months of GI Bill benefits.

- Certain children of Vietnam Veterans and Veterans with covered service in Korea have a **MAX** eligibility of 24 months _instead_ of 48 months.

2. Rapid Access to Employment

3. Self-Employment

4. Employment Through Long-Term Services

5. Independent Living


* * *

### 1\. Reemployment

Assists Veterans in regaining employment with their _former_ employer. This may be accomplished by providing the employer assistance/equipment in accommodating the Veteran.

Examples of some of the tools that will be made available include:

Your counseling team will be there to assist you in developing a viable long term business plan.

Examples of some of the tools that will be made available include:

- Analysis of your business concept

- Training in small-business operations, marketing, and finances

- Tuition assistance to obtain needed certifications/licenses for the business

- Financial assistance to cover applicable fees as well as related business startup costs


NOTES:

- This track is more-so for those who have limited access to traditional employment, need flexible work schedules, or need a more accommodating work environment due to their disabling conditions or other life circumstances.

- The VA **MUST** approve your business plan _before_ they start offering you training/funding.

* * *

### 5\. Independent Living

For Veterans who's service-connected disabilities limit their ability to perform activities of daily living (like bathing, dressing, accessing the community, and interacting with others) and can’t return to work right away.

- This track has _advanced_ eligibility requirements:

  - Must have a serious employment handicap; **AND**

## **Applying**

There are 2 ways to apply:

1. Online

   - To apply online click [HERE](https://www.va.gov/careers-employment/vocational-rehabilitation/apply-vre-form-28-1900/start).
2. Mail - If you just _have_ to support the post office you may complete a [VA Form 28-1900](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-28-1900/) and mail the completed form to:


> ```
>  Department of Veterans Affairs
>  VR&E Intake Center
>  P.O. Box 5210
>  Janesville, WI 53547-5210
> ```

* * *

### VA Form 28-1902W

Eventually you will be asked to complete a VA Form 28-1902W. This form helps your Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC) create a path to success for you using VR&E.

Complete the form to the best of your abilities!

NOTES:

- **READ** the (notes) in the gray boxes of the SECTIONS to save yourself time filling in duplicate information.

- In SECTION IX, this is where you let your VRC know what you’re interested in so they can prepare (labor market search, programs near you, review daily tasks, etc). This helps them go into your appointment with more specific questions **AND** so they don’t have to spend 1-2 hours filling out paperwork. Thus giving them time to actually have a conversation with you! That and potentially develop your plan sooner!


* * *

### After Approval and Plan is Developed

**IT IS CRITICAL** that you actually sign the plan **AND** turn the plan in! Your VRC **CANNOT** process your plan without the signed plan and debt prevention document. So don’t just walk away and turn up mad when the VA has not funded anything because **_YOU DIDN’T_** finish your part!

[Return to top](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vre#top)

## **Other Benefits of VRE**

To increase the odds of success, the VA offers additional benefits to those using the program.

* * *

### Advanced Health Care Coverage

* * *

### Subsistence Allowance

Veterans doing tracks that have them doing some kind of educational or training program _may_ be eligible for a monthly subsistence allowance. This allowance does vary based upon your rate of pursuit as well as type of program you are doing.

- Veterans who have **AT LEAST 1 DAY** of [Post 9/11 GI Bill](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/gibill) will receive Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) at the E-5 with dependent rate for their location.

- Veterans who have exhausted their Post 9/11 GI Bill or simply don't have it will be paid at the standard chapter 31 subsistence allowance rate.


The BAH amount is far more generous than the standard rate.

- To see the current rates for the subsistence allowance click [HERE](https://www.benefits.va.gov/vocrehab/subsistence_allowance_rates.asp).

- To see the current rates for BAH at the E-5 with dependent rate click [HERE](https://www.travel.dod.mil/Allowances/Basic-Allowance-for-Housing/BAH-Rate-Lookup/).


**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- Even if you are less than half time you **ARE** entitled to your allowance.

- Depending on your [Work tolerance](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/38/21.312), you _can_ be paid at your full rate even if less than full time.

- After graduation from an educational _or_ training program you _can_ be approved for up to an _additional_ **2 MONTHS** of subsistence allowance under employment adjustment allowance - letting you to look for employment and worry less about income. You will need to provide evidence that you are actively applying for jobs.

- Those who started using their POST 9/11 GI BIll **BEFORE** VR&E **CAN** have their GI Bill usage considered as Chapter 31 via _retroactive induction_, thus possibly restoring POST 9/11 eligibility if it was previously used up.

  - Click [HERE](https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018/content/554400000143066/M28CVB6-Direct-Reimbursement-and-Retroactive-Induction#a%206.02) for details.

NOTE:

- You will need to apply for the Post 9/11 GI Bill to show you are still eligible/have eligibility left for it - in order to get the BAH rate; you will **NOT** be using up any of your GI Bill entitlement by using VR&E.

## **Frequently** **Asked Questions**

- #### I'm having trouble with my Case Manager/VRC. What can I do?






- Click [HERE](https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018/content/554400000260798/VRE-School-Certifying-Official-Handbook) to find the contact information for your Case Manager's boss at your nearest Regional Office.


- #### Will I loose TDIU if I go through VR&E?






- No, only if after you complete the program you are able to maintain gainful employment for at least 12 continuous months.


- #### If I use VR&E, can this result in my rating being reevaluated?






- No, using VR&E will **NOT** trigger a reevaluation.


- #### Can I do VR&E if I am currently employed?






- Yes.


- #### Can I do VR&E if I am TDIU?






- Yes.


- #### Can I use VR&E and use the GI Bill at the same time?






- No.


- #### Can I use VR&E and DEA at the same time?






- No, you **CANNOT** use them at the same time.


- #### I did not earn the full 100% rate for the POST 9/11 GI bill. Would my amount of the BAH be reduced in kind?






- No, the amount of BAH you would get is **NOT** impacted!


- #### Can I use a VR&E overseas?






- Yes, it is possible to get approval.


- #### The VA severed/reduced my conditions and I no longer meet the requirements to VR&E what happens now?






- If you never applied then nothing.

- If you were actively using it then your benefit will likely end. If you are currently taking classes, you will be allowed to finish the term. You’d be responsible for paying for the next term or you could potentially use a different education benefit (if you wanted to continue).


- #### Do I report untaxed income (such as VA disability) on my Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)?






- **NO!**


- #### Should I bother completing FAFSA or getting scholarships/grants when VA will be paying for classes anyway?






- **YES**! Even if the VA does cover everything you **CAN** generally pocket that money after everything filters through your school!

  - How this works is: School counts up what all fees and tuition you owe and offsets that by any loans, scholarships, grants, etc. If there ends up being a positive balance in your account when everything is said and done you will be refunded that positive balance! If the school applies your loans, scholarships, etc before VA pays the school **THAT IS FINE**! As in the end, the VA will pay the school as appropriate meaning any left over positive balance is still **YOURS**!

    - Tuition assistance through say a job will not result in you pocketing that money. You will in essence be giving the government a discount is all.

    - Scholarships and grants can be pocketed! So be sure to file for them!

- #### Can I get the full BAH amount if I take online only courses?






- No, if full time then you will get ½ the national average BAH rate (assuming you are eligible to get BAH).

  - If you are less than full time, then your allowance will be prorated as appropriate.

- #### Can I get BAH if I am going to a foreign school (in-person)?






- If you are full time then you are entitled to 100% of the national average of the BAH rate (assuming you are eligible to get BAH).

  - If you are less than full time, then your allowance will be prorated as appropriate.

- #### Can I get BAH if I am going to a school in a US Territory (in-person)?






- Technically no… **BUT** if you are full timeyou are entitled to 100% of the Overseas Housing Allowance (OHA) based on the OHA rate of the school (assuming you are eligible to get BAH).

  - If you are less than full time, then your allowance will be prorated as appropriate.

- #### When do I get paid my housing allowance!?






- Two things:

1. VA pays in arrears meaning: You are paid at the end of the of the month for the same month. So - September is paid at the **END** of September, etc.

2. Benefits are paid out by the Treasury Department using a **_10 business day window_** centered around the end of the month. Meaning - there is no specific date each month the Treasury is required to pay any VA education benefits.

- #### I know VA disability does not pro-rate disability payments. But can my housing allowance get pro-rated?






**YES**! Unlike VA disability, education benefits **ARE** prorated (getting paid for partial months).
