The Department of Veteran Affairs offers several different types of education opportunities, each with their own eligibility requirements and benefit amounts.

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- Veterans have a lifetime limit of **48 months** of GI Bill benefits.

  - This limit does **NOT** prevent the Veteran from using other education benefits such as the rehabilitation program under [Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E)](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vre). **HOWEVER**, using your GI Bill **BEFORE** VR&E - goes against the limit usages for VR&E **UNLESS**:

    - The GI Bill usage is considered as having been under VR&E via _retroactive induction_. In which case, the VA would restore the GI Bill eligibility (months used) and count the months used against the VR&E entitlement only.

      - Click [HERE](https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018/content/554400000143066/M28CVB6-Direct-Reimbursement-and-Retroactive-Induction#a%206.02) for details.
- It **IS** possible for someone to use 48 months of VR&E benefits and then separately use 48 months of GI Bill benefits.

- If you reenlisted at least once while on Active Duty and your last period of service was _Other than Honorable_ you can be eligible to _at least some_ GI bill benefits since that prior period **IS** considered to be Honorable!

- VA disability direct deposit information is **NOT** shared with the education arm of things, meaning you **NEED** to set this up!

- Benefits are **NOT PAID** when you are not using the benefit… meaning if you are not taking summer/winter courses you will **NOT** get benefits during those months! So be prepared!

- Those using their parent’s GI Bill **MUST** do so **BEFORE** turning 26 years old!

- Spouses using their spouse’s GI Bill **MUST** do so:

  - Within 15 years from date of separation, if spouse separated before January 1, 2013.

    - No limit if spouse separated on or after January 1, 2013.

* * *

## **Chapter 30 (Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) - Active Duty)**

Benefits are generally payable for **10 years** following your release from _honorable_ active service.

**IMPORTANT UPDATE:**

- On April 16, 2024 the [Supreme Court of the United States decided](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/22-888_1b8e.pdf?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR1jgVkoU9pyW0_VUZ1quTTk9j_TgooxAcctNaiucPODSCf5e_yuokuHx7E_aem_AeZxOBBdYe_TbCLrTWjlbWeUyPkJj21guJkOHfF1gkENinJrzKFa-3YXbIq-hbQ0eSSD71Qbblu2C8ZIvsn8xkph) that if you served at least two periods ( **CAN** include a reenlistment _without_ a break in service) of service-one that qualifies for the Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) and another that qualifies for the Post-9/11 GI Bill (PGIB)-you may be able to receive additional GI Bill benefits.

If you are attending at least one class in a classroom you _may_ be entitled to receive a housing allowance equal to the military BAH for an E-5 with dependents at the location of the school where the majority of the classes are being taken.

Whether you want to apply your GI Bill benefits to college classes or an on-the-job training program, the [GI Bill Comparison Tool](https://www.vets.gov/gi-bill-comparison-tool) will help you make the most of them.

**IMPORTANT UPDATE:**

- On April 16, 2024 the [Supreme Court of the United States decided](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/22-888_1b8e.pdf?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR1jgVkoU9pyW0_VUZ1quTTk9j_TgooxAcctNaiucPODSCf5e_yuokuHx7E_aem_AeZxOBBdYe_TbCLrTWjlbWeUyPkJj21guJkOHfF1gkENinJrzKFa-3YXbIq-hbQ0eSSD71Qbblu2C8ZIvsn8xkph) that if you served at least two periods ( **CAN** include a reenlistment _without_ a break in service) of service-one that qualifies for the Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) and another that qualifies for the Post-9/11 GI Bill (PGIB)-you may be able to receive additional GI Bill benefits.

  - For additional information click [HERE](https://benefits.va.gov/gibill/rudisill.asp).

* * *

### Eligibility

Have an honorable period of Active Duty service on or after September 10, 2001.

Certain members of the Reserves who lost education benefits when REAP was sunset in November 2015 may also be eligible to receive restored benefits under the Post-9/11 GI Bill.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- Veterans have **15 years** to use this benefit _if discharged before_ **January 1, 2013**.

  - If discharged _after_ January 1, 2013, there is **NO** time limit!

* * *

### Benefits

For approved programs, the Post-9/11 GI Bill provides up to 36 months of education benefits.

Full tuition and mandatory fees are paid directly to the school for all public higher learning institutions.

For those attending _private or foreign schools_, tuition and fees are capped at the [National maximum rate](https://www.benefits.va.gov/GIBILL/resources/benefits_resources/rates/ch33/ch33rates080120.asp).

If you're attending a private higher learning institution you _may_ be eligible for the [Yellow Ribbon Program](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/yellow) and entitled to additional education-related costs not covered by VA.

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- Public colleges/universities **MUST** charge Veterans **AND** dependents in-state tuition by [Law](https://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/post911_residentraterequirements.asp) so long as you are using the Post 9/11 benefit and _are not_ on Active Duty!

  - You **MUST** however still follow the institution’s residency requirements which will likely include living in their state.

    - The requirement of living in the state for X time **MUST BE WAIVED**!
- Rate of pursuit (how many credits you take a term) **DOES** prorate your length of benefit!

  - If your rate of pursuit is say 50% for a 4 month term then only use 2 months of your 36 month total benefit is used **NOT** 4!

  - Taking _over_ a full load of credits does **NOT** draw your benefits more than if you were just at full time!
- If the benefit runs out during a semester (even if the Veteran only has a single day!) the VA will pay full tuition and the Veteran's MHA till the end of the semester!


Depending on factors such as length of service will determine the amount of benefit(s) you can receive from the VA:

| Active Duty Service/Special Circumstance | Percentage of Maximum Benefit Payable |
| --- | --- |
| At least 36 months. | 100% |
| Received a Purple Heart. | 100% |
| At least 30 _continuous days_ on Active Duty **AND** [Discharged due to a service-connected disability.](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/medboard) | 100% |
| At least 30 months, but less than 36 months. | 90% |
| At least 24 months, but less than 30 months. | 80% |
| At least 18 months, but less than 24 months. | 70% |
| At least 6 months, but less than 18 months. | 60% |
| At least 90 days, but less than 6 months. | 50% |

* * *

#### Enrollment Verification

In order to get paid your MHA you must verify your attendance to the VA. This can be done one of three ways:

1\. Text Message (US phone numbers ONLY)

- Opt-In:

  - Before your semester starts you _should_ receive a text message asking if you would like to submit verification via text. Simply reply back with "Yes".
- Verify:

  - On the last day of the month you will receive a text asking if you are still enrolled. Provide a response and you are set!

2\. Email

- Opt-In:

  - If you have opted out of the text message option you will automatically be set up for email verification.
- Verify:

  - On the last day of the month you will get an email asking for you to verify your enrollment. Select the option in the email that applies to you.

3\. Call the Education Call Center (ECC)

- Opt-In:

  - Not applicable - you just do it.
- Verify:

  - Call 1-888-442-4551 _or_ 001-918-781-5678 if you are international.

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- When you text a response to verify your enrollment, it is **COMMON** to **NOT** get a response for an hour or 2, so do no panic if you do not get a response back right away!

- Failure to verify for 2 months in a row **WILL** result in your MHA being suspended! To restart payments you will need to call the ECC.


* * *

### Book & Supply Stipend

You may also receive a books and supplies stipend up to $1,000 each year (the amount _is_ prorated if you are less than full time).

* * *

### Monthly Housing Allowance (MHA)

Monthly housing allowance (often mistakenly called BAH) is calculated based on the zip code of the campus where the student physically attends the majority of classes, rather than the location of the institution of higher learning where the student is enrolled. This applies to the first enrollment in an educational program on or after August 1, 2018.

- To figure out how much you stand to get a month click [HERE](https://www.va.gov/gi-bill-comparison-tool/).


**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- In order to get MHA you **MUST** be enrolled **OVER HALF TIME**! Those who are enrolled half time or less will **NOT GET ANY MHA**!

  - Those enrolled over half time but less than full time will have their MHA prorated.

  - For those in graduate program, the school determines what is considered full time.

  - For those in an undergraduate program to be full time:

    - 12 credit hours during a typical Fall/Spring semester;

    - 6 credit hours during a typical Summer semester;

    - 3 credit hours during a typical Winter semester;

    - NOTE: Those in accelerated programs _may_ achieve full time with fewer credits.
- MHA is prorated on a 30 day calendar. No matter how many days are actually in the month. So if that course started on February 21, you would be paid 9/30 the normal MHA amount for the month of February.

  - For more examples click [HERE](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/money#education).
- People who have courses that start/stop on different dates may have their amount of MHA reduced, if they fall below full time status.

- Round-Out Rule: If during your last semester, your remaining credits to graduate is _less than_ what you need to be considered full time. You **CAN** take non-required courses to fill up your schedule to achieve full time _without_ penalty.

  - If you do **NOT** fill up on courses then your MHA will be **REDUCED** appropriately!

* * *

### Rural Benefit

A one time payment of $500 may be payable to certain Veterans relocating from highly rural areas (county with 6 persons or less per square mile (as determined by the most recent decennial census)) and either:

- Physically relocate at least 500 miles to attend an educational institution; or

- Travel by air to physically attend an educational institution if no other land-based transportation exists.


* * *

### Kicker AKA Branch College Fund

Veterans who joined an MOS that was listed as having a critical shortage of personnel may have gotten a kicker that increased their benefit.

The maximum is an additional $950 a month. Which was based upon the length of your initial contract.

The Veteran will be paid their kicker amount every month. If the Veteran's rate of pursuit is less than full time their kicker amount will be reduced. If the month is less than a full month the kicker will be prorated as well.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- If the Veteran does not receive MHA they will **NOT** get their kicker!


[Return to top](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#top)

## **Chapter 1606 (Montgomery GI Bill - Selected Reserve)**

MGIB-SR program provides education and training benefits to eligible members of the Selected Reserve, including the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard Reserve, Army National Guard or Air National Guard. Eligibility for this program is determined by the Selected Reserve components and the VA makes the payments.

* * *

### Benefits

May be used for college degree and certificate programs, co-op training, technical or vocational courses, flight training, apprenticeships or on-the-job training, high-tech training, licensing and certification tests, entrepreneurship training, certain entrance examinations, and correspondence courses. Remedial, deficiency, and refresher courses may be approved under certain circumstances.

Up to 36 months of education benefits.

* * *

### Kicker AKA Branch College Fund

Veterans who joined an MOS that was listed as having a critical shortage of personnel may have gotten a kicker that increased their benefit.

The maximum is an additional $350 a month, which was based upon the length of your initial contract.

The Veteran will be paid their kicker amount as a pro-rated lump sum (for however long the semester is and their percentage of degree of pursuit) at the start of the semester.

* * *

### Eligibility

To qualify, you must meet the following requirements:

- Have a 6-year obligation to serve in the Selected Reserve signed after June 30, 1985. If you are an officer, you must have agreed to serve 6 years in addition to your original obligation. For some types of training it is necessary to have a 6-year commitment that begins after September 30, 1990.

- Complete your initial Active Duty for Training (IADT). Meet the requirement to receive a high school diploma or equivalency certificate before completing IADT. You may not use 12 hours toward a college degree to meet this requirement.

- Remain in good standing while serving in an active Selected Reserve unit. You will also retain MGIB-SR eligibility if you were discharged from Selected Reserve service due to a disability that was not caused by misconduct. Your eligibility period may be extended if you are ordered to active duty.


Your eligibility for this program normally ends the day you leave the Selected Reserve.

An exception exists if you are mobilized or recalled to Active Duty from your reserve status in which case your eligibility may be extended for the amount of time you are mobilized PLUS 4 months. For example, if you are mobilized for 12 months, your eligibility period is extended for 16 months; 12 months of Active Duty PLUS 4 months. Even if you leave the Reserves after mobilization, you may have additional eligibility under the MGIB-SR.

If your unit was deactivated during the period beginning October 1, 2007, through September 30, 2014, or you were involuntarily separated for reasons other than misconduct, you will retain your original period of eligibility, which is 14 years from the date of your first 6-year obligation with the Selected Reserves.

## **Frequently** **Asked Questions**

- #### Do I report untaxed income (such as VA disability) on my Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)?






- **NO!**


- #### Should I bother completing FAFSA or getting scholarships/grants when VA will be paying for everything anyway?






- **YES**! Even if the VA does cover everything you **CAN** generally pocket that money after everything filters through your school!

  - How this works is: School counts up what all fees and tuition you owe and offsets that by any loans, scholarships, grants, etc. If there ends up being a positive balance in your account when everything is said and done you will be refunded that positive balance! If the school applies your loans, scholarships, etc before VA pays the school **THAT IS FINE**! As in the end, the VA will pay the school as appropriate meaning any left over positive balance is still **YOURS**!

    - Tuition assistance through say a job will not result in you pocketing that money. You will in essence be giving the government a discount is all.

    - Scholarships and grants can be pocketed! So be sure to file for them!

- #### If I switch to the Post 9/11 GI Bill can I get my $1,200 back?






- Yes, if you exhaust all 36 months you will get the money back in your final MHA payment. If you are **NOT** receiving MHA in your final month then you will **NOT** get this money back automatically!


- #### Will I have to repay the VA if I fail a course?






- No, so long as the Veteran did not fail due to failure to attend the course (the professor annotated that the Veteran failed purely due to non-attendance). This is not to be confused with failure due to poor performance that may have been due to non/poor attendance.


- #### Will I have to repay the VA if I drop (withdraw) a course?






- Maybe, if the course(s) you drop do not put you below full time you will not create any debt.

If the course(s) you drop put you below full time you **may** create a debt.

**UNLESS** this is the first time dropping 6 credits (that puts you below full time). This is known as the [6 credit hour exclusion](https://www.va.gov/resources/how-your-reason-for-withdrawing-from-a-class-affects-your-va-debt/)

If you are going beyond this exclusion, you may still not owe a debt if you were/are experiencing [Mitigating circumstances](https://www.va.gov/resources/how-your-reason-for-withdrawing-from-a-class-affects-your-va-debt/).

Otherwise, yes. You will owe a debt.


- #### I was told I owe a debt, can I request a debt waiver?






- Yes.

  - For information click [HERE](https://www.va.gov/resources/waivers-for-va-benefit-debt/).

- #### Can I transfer my education benefits?






- If you have already separated **NO**!

- If you were a member of the Armed Forces on August 1, 2009 and eligible for the Post-9/11 GI Bill, the Department of Defense (DoD) offers you the opportunity to transfer benefits to your spouse or dependents.

For any deaths occurring on or after August 1, 2009:

If the dependent you transferred benefits to dies, the Veteran/Servicemember may transfer any remaining unused benefits to a different eligible dependent.

If a dependent has received transferred entitlement and the Veteran/Servicemember dies, the dependent may transfer his or her unused benefits to a different eligible dependent of the Veteran/Servicemember.

Commissioned officers of the Public Health Service (PHS) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) are eligible for the transferability option effective August 1, 2011. While in the Armed Forces, transferors use the Transfer of Education Benefits (TEB) website to designate, modify, and revoke a Transfer of Entitlement (TOE) request. After leaving the Armed Forces, transferors may provide a future effective date for use of TOE, modify the number of months transferred, or revoke entitlement transferred by submitting a written request to VA.

NOTE:

  - After separating from the Armed Forces individuals cannot designate new dependents to receive transferred entitlement or amend the effective date of the initial transfer of entitlement to an earlier date.

- #### Can I use multiple education programs at the same time if I qualify for them?






- No, you can only use one program at a time.


- #### If I use up all of my GI bill benefits (run out of months) during the term what happens?






- VA will pay out benefits to include tuition/mandatory fees for the remainder of the term.

  - **UNLESS** you are a dependent using your parent’s GI bill! In which case, your benefit will end as detailed in the next question.

- #### If my GI bill expires (delimiting date) during the term what happens?






- VA will prorate the tuition/mandatory fees to the delimiting date and stop paying any housing allowance once you get to that delimiting date.


- #### I received something other than an Honorable discharge can I still qualify for the GI Bill?






It depends!



If you reenlisted once or had an appropriate prior period of service that was honorable then you are good to go!



**IMPORTANT NOTE:**



- If the period of service(s) (time between reenlistment(s)) was shorter than the time needed to earn the full entitlement, then your benefit will be prorated appropriately.


- #### If I receive an Other than Honorable discharge from the Reserves/National Guard can I lose my Active Duty GI Bill?






- So long as that GI Bill was earned from a period of honorable service, you good.


- #### I know you just answered it... but what about if the GI Bill is from a deployment I did in the Reserves/Guard?






- You are still entitled to your GI Bill assuming of course that deployment resulted in an Honorable discharge. A following period of service is not going to take that prior entitlement away.


- #### Can I use my education benefits overseas?






- [Yes](https://www.va.gov/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/how-to-use-benefits/study-at-foreign-schools/), you can use your benefits so long as:

  - The program is at an institution of higher learning where you’ll earn a standard associate degree or higher, or an equivalent degree at that foreign school; **AND**

  - The VA has approved your program.

- #### Can I go to multiple schools at the same time?






- You **CANNOT** use your GI Bill at two different schools at the same time to get 2 _separate_ degrees.

- You **CAN** use your GI Bill at 2 separate schools if all courses are being applied toward 1 degree (concurrent enrollment).

- You **CAN** use your GI Bill at 1 school and separately fund another degree at a separate school yourself.


- #### Why do online only programs pay half the national average rate instead of the full amount?






- To discourage schools/Vets from milking their benefits for the housing allowance instead of getting a worthwhile degree. When Congress was contemplating giving online programs housing allowance, schools were propping up shell campuses at high allowance locations to lure Vets to their online programs. So to help prevent this issue, it was decided that half the national rate would be best.


- #### When do I get paid my housing allowance!?






- Two things:

1. VA pays in arrears meaning: You are paid at the end of the of the month for the same month. So - September is paid at the **END** of September, etc.

2. Benefits are paid out by the Treasury Department using a **_10 business day window_** centered around the end of the month. Meaning - there is no specific date each month the Treasury is required to pay any VA education benefits.

- #### I know VA disability does not pro-rate disability payments. But can my housing allowance get pro-rated?






- **YES**! Unlike VA disability, education benefits **ARE** prorated (getting paid for partial months).


- #### I qualify for both the Montgomery and the Post 9/11, which is best?






- This answer varies from person to person and what exactly they want to use their benefit on and their specific circumstances.

  - Math breaks down to this in short: Does the Monty stipend or Post, let me pocket the most?

    - While in most cases, Post comes out on top - this is **NOT** always the case. So it would behoove you to check.
