| ### VIII.iv.1.A.1.a.  Definition:  PTSD |  | **_Posttraumatic stress disorder_** ( **_PTSD_**) is a psychiatric disorder that may occur in people who have experienced or witnessed a traumatic event, also known as a stressor. |

* * *

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ### VIII.iv.1.A.1.b.  Definition:  Stressor |  | A PTSD **_stressor_** is a traumatic event (or series of events) in which an individual has been personally or indirectly exposed to actual or threatened<br>- death<br>  <br>- serious injury, or<br>  <br>- sexual violence.<br>  <br>Claims processors need to identify which stressor type a Veteran’s claim falls under, so that proper development will occur.  Claims can be based on a stressor related to<br>- an in-service PTSD diagnosis<br>  <br>- personal assault<br>  <br>- combat or former prisoner of war (FPOW) service<br>  <br>- fear, or<br>  <br>- a stressful event unrelated to hostile military or terrorist activity.<br>  <br>**_Notes_**: <br>- PTSD has the same claim elements regardless of the type of stressor.  The distinction between the different types of PTSD claims is based on how the stressor is verified or conceded.<br>  <br>- Veterans will not generally know what category their stressor falls in or what evidence is needed to support it, so it is incumbent on the claims processor to make that determination, considering that some stressor types have a lower evidentiary threshold than others. |

| ### VIII.iv.1.A.1.c.  Developing Claims of SC for PTSD Due to In-Service Stressors |  | When a Veteran claims service connection (SC) for PTSD associated with an in-service stressor, undertake development as necessary for<br>- credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred<br>  <br>- medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with [38 CFR 4.125](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=fa147f1fcb9203350440f9242f1b8e27&node=se38.1.4_1125&rgn=div8), and<br>  <br>- a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptomatology and the claimed in-service stressor.<br>  <br>**_References_**:  For more information on <br>- credible evidence, see [M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 1.A.2.b](https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018/content/554400000014383/M21-1-Part-V-Subpart-ii-Chapter-1-Section-A-Principles-of-Reviewing-and-Weighing-Evidence)<br>- establishing SC for PTSD, see<br>  - [38 CFR 3.304(f)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=fa147f1fcb9203350440f9242f1b8e27&node=se38.1.3_1304&rgn=div8), and<br>    <br>  - [38 U.S.C. 1154(b)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/38/1154)<br>- duty to assist with requesting records, see [M21-1, Part III, Subpart i, 2.C](https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018/content/554400000014102/M21-1-Part-III-Subpart-i-Chapter-2-Section-C-Duty-to-Assist-With-Obtaining-Records), and<br>- when to request evidence from the Veteran to establish an in-service stressor, see [M21-1, Part VIII, Subpart iv, 1.A.2](https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018/content/554400000177468/M21-1-Part-VIII-Subpart-iv-Chapter-1-Section-A-General-Information-and-Development-for-Posttraumatic-Stress-Disorder-PTSD-Claims#2). |

| ### VIII.iv.1.A.1.d.  Responsibility for Stressor Verification |  | Claims processors must review all evidence of record to determine if credible supporting evidence that a claimed in-service stressor occurred is of record prior to undertaking any additional development.<br>When evidence of record is not sufficient to concede the claimed stressor, additional steps to corroborate the claim must be undertaken, including<br>- obtaining all military or other medical records and additional stressor information, when needed, as noted in [M21-1, Part VIII, Subpart iv, 1.A.2](https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018/content/554400000177468/M21-1-Part-VIII-Subpart-iv-Chapter-1-Section-A-General-Information-and-Development-for-Posttraumatic-Stress-Disorder-PTSD-Claims#2)<br>  <br>- attempting concession of the stressor based on the criteria noted in [M21-1, VIII, Subpart iv, 1.A.3](https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018/content/554400000177468/M21-1-Part-VIII-Subpart-iv-Chapter-1-Section-A-General-Information-and-Development-for-Posttraumatic-Stress-Disorder-PTSD-Claims#3), and<br>  <br>- performing additional stressor corroboration procedures by the regional office (RO) Research Coordinator as outlined in [M21-1 Part VIII, Subpart iv, 1.A.4](https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018/content/554400000177468/M21-1-Part-VIII-Subpart-iv-Chapter-1-Section-A-General-Information-and-Development-for-Posttraumatic-Stress-Disorder-PTSD-Claims#4).<br>  <br>**_Important_**:  It is the responsibility of Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) claims processors to establish the occurrence of the event the Veteran claims to have resulted in PTSD.  A medical professional makes the determination of whether an event is sufficient to meet the stressor criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD.<br>**_Reference_**:  For more information on developing for personal trauma stressors, see [M21-1, Part VIII, Subpart iv, 1.B](https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018/content/554400000177469/M21-1-Part-VIII-Subpart-iv-Chapter-1-Section-B-Development-for-Posttraumatic-Stress-Disorder-PTSD-or-Other-Claims-Related-to-Personal-Trauma). |

| ### VIII.iv.1.A.1.e.  Verification of In-Service Stressors Using Available Resources |  | The stressor verification process must include a review of information from [VBA-sanctioned stressor research websites](https://vbaw.vba.va.gov/bl/21/rating/rat06f.htm) and the Official Military Activities Report ( [OMAR](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/sites/OMAR/SitePages/Home.aspx)) tool.  OMAR is a VBA-sanctioned research tool that aggregates several approved data sources for stressor verification.  <br>_**Notes**_:  <br>- When using evidence obtained from either a VBA-sanctioned stressor research website or the OMAR tool, carefully note the stressor source and weigh the evidence appropriately.<br>- Stressor research using the OMAR tool is generally the responsibility of the RO Research Coordinator.<br>_**References**_:  For more information on <br>- VBA-sanctioned stressor research sites, see the [PTSD Rating Job Aids website](http://vbaw.vba.va.gov/bl/21/rating/rat06.htm), and<br>  <br>- conducting stressor research in the OMAR tool, see the [OMAR training videos](https://app.powerbigov.us/groups/me/apps/00ece2c3-4e5e-4949-b0c0-abd5016b4989/reports/3c41dadd-96a3-4846-850b-7e3e0f64bb4d/ReportSection?ctid=e95f1b23-abaf-45ee-821d-b7ab251ab3bf). |

| ### VIII.iv.1.A.3.a.  How Stressors Are Claimed |  | While claims for SC of PTSD require a standard claim form, stressors do not require a specific claim form.  Stressors can be researched based on information found in<br>- _[VA Form 21-0781](http://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-21-0781-ARE.PDF)_<br>  <br>- lay statements<br>  <br>- military records in which a stressor can be inferred based on<br>  <br>  - combat participation, or<br>    <br>  - service in an area consistent with hostile military or terrorist activity, or<br>- medical records or statements made to an examiner.<br>  <br>**_Note_**:  In some cases, such as combat or fear-based stressors, examinations can be ordered without specific stressor details.  However, if the examination is returned with a PTSD diagnosis, verify the stressor associated with the diagnosis is consistent with the places and circumstances of service. <br>**_Reference_**:  For more information on examinations in claims for SC for PTSD, see [M21-1, Part VIII, Subpart iv, 1.C](https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018/content/554400000177713/M21-1-Part-VIII-Subpart-iv-Chapter-1-Section-C-Examinations-and-Medical-Opinions-for-Posttraumatic-Stress-Disorder-PTSD-Claims). |

| ### VIII.iv.1.A.3.b.  When a Veteran’s Lay Testimony Alone May Establish an In-Service Stressor |  | A Veteran’s lay testimony alone may, under specified circumstances, establish an in-service stressor for purposes of establishing SC for PTSD if<br>- PTSD is diagnosed in service, and the stressor is related to that service, or<br>  <br>- the stressor is related to the Veteran’s<br>  <br>  -

| ### VIII.iv.1.A.3.c.  Reviewing for Credible Supporting Evidence of a Stressor |  | Review the claim for credible supporting evidence that a claimed in-service stressor occurred when the stressor cannot be conceded based on the Veteran’s lay statement as described in [M21-1, Part VIII, Subpart iv, 1.A.3.b](https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018/content/554400000177468/M21-1-Part-VIII-Subpart-iv-Chapter-1-Section-A-General-Information-and-Development-for-Posttraumatic-Stress-Disorder-PTSD-Claims#3b).<br>**_Credible supporting evidence_** is evidence that<br>- documents the Veteran's participation in the event<br>  <br>- indicates the Veteran served in the immediate area and at the particular time in which the stressful event is reported to have occurred, and<br>  <br>- supports the description of the event.<br>  <br>Credible supporting evidence of a stressor may be obtained from sources other than service records.  When reviewing evidence to corroborate a claimed in-service stressor, claims processors must consider the credibility and probative value of the evidence to determine if the stressor is consistent with the circumstances of the Veteran’s service.<br>**_Notes_**:<br>- Corroboration of every detail is not required.<br>  <br>- Evidence may be sufficient if it implies a Veteran's personal exposure to the event.<br>  <br>- Evaluate the evidence as a whole to determine whether a stressor is sufficiently corroborated.<br>  <br>**_Important_**:  While it is incumbent upon each claims processor to review evidence to determine if a claimed in-service stressor can be conceded, stressor concession is ultimately the rating activity's responsibility.<br>**_References_**:  For more information on<br>- the stressor verification review procedure, see [M21-1, Part VIII, Subpart iv, 1.A.3.d](https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018/content/554400000177468/M21-1-Part-VIII-Subpart-iv-Chapter-1-Section-A-General-Information-and-Development-for-Posttraumatic-Stress-Disorder-PTSD-Claims#3d)<br>  <br>- credible supporting evidence of a stressor, see [M21-1, Part VIII, Subpart iv, 1.D.2.f and g](https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018/content/554400000177714/M21-1-Part-VIII-Subpart-iv-Chapter-1-Section-D-Evidence-Evaluation-and-Decisions-for-Posttraumatic-Stress-Disorder-PTSD-Claims)<br>  <br>- reviewing evidence for corroboration of a stressor, see [M21-1, Part VIII, Subpart iv, 1.D.2.h](https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018/content/554400000177714/M21-1-Part-VIII-Subpart-iv-Chapter-1-Section-D-Evidence-Evaluation-and-Decisions-for-Posttraumatic-Stress-Disorder-PTSD-Claims), and<br>  <br>- weighing evidence, see [M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 1.A](https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018/content/554400000014383/M21-1-Part-V-Subpart-ii-Chapter-1-Section-A-Principles-of-Reviewing-and-Weighing-Evidence). |

| ### VIII.iv.1.A.3.n.  Use of APO Mailbox Information to Verify Republic of Vietnam Service |  | The listing of Army post office (APO) address numbers for the Asian Pacific Theater during the Vietnam Era contains APO numbers for all major Army and Air Force bases in Asia, including Vietnam, Korea, Thailand, Japan, Taiwan, Okinawa, Guam, and the Philippines.  Review the record, to include personnel and medical records, for an APO number written or stamped in the records.  As this is official evidence of the Veteran’s presence at that location, the listing can assist with establishing service in a location of potential hostile military or terrorist activity.<br>**_Note_**:  The APO listing is available on the Compensation Service Intranet website under the [Stressor Verification Site](http://vbaw.vba.va.gov/bl/21/rating/stressor/general.htm).  To access the  listing, open the _General Information_ folder and click on _General 1942-2002 APO-FPO Files_.  Each APO number is shown along with the location it identifies and the previous number that it replaced.  When successive locations are identified with the same APO number, the dates of use at each location are specified as well as the close-out date. |

| ### VIII.iv.1.A.3.o.  Minimum Information Required to Research an In-Service Stressor |  | When initial review of the available sources of evidence does not establish an in-service stressor, the next step is to determine if additional research and development is possible.  At a minimum, in order to undertake the additional research, the Veteran or available records _must_ provide the following:<br>- a stressor that can be documented<br>  <br>- the location where the event took place<br>  <br>- the approximate date (within a two-month period) of the event, and<br>  <br>- the unit of assignment at the time the stressful event occurred. <br>  <br>**_Notes_**:<br>- For casualty-related stressors, the full name and unit designation of the casualty is preferred.  However, this information is not required for research as long as a description of the casualty event is given.  When the name and/or unit of a casualty is of record, this information must be included in any research request submitted to Records Acquisition and Research (RAR).<br>- Only RO Research Coordinators are authorized to submit stressor research requests to RAR.<br>- Specific details of claimed stressful events may also be gathered from such sources as VA or private medical treatment reports and examination reports.<br>- Claims processors may obtain the date and location of well-documented events, such as the Tet Offensive, from VBA-sanctioned websites (available through the [PTSD Rating Job Aid website](http://vbaw.vba.va.gov/bl/21/rating/rat06f.htm)) and supply this information on the Veteran’s behalf.<br>**_References_**:  For more information on the<br>- types of stressors that may be impossible to corroborate, see [M21-1, Part VIII, Subpart iv, 1.A.3.p](https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018/content/554400000177468/M21-1-Part-VIII-Subpart-iv-Chapter-1-Section-A-General-Information-and-Development-for-Posttraumatic-Stress-Disorder-PTSD-Claims#3p), and<br>- onset of PTSD in service due to a pre-service stressor, see [M21-1, Part VIII, Subpart iv, 1.D.1.e](https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018/content/554400000177714/M21-1-Part-VIII-Subpart-iv-Chapter-1-Section-D-Evidence-Evaluation-and-Decisions-for-Posttraumatic-Stress-Disorder-PTSD-Claims). |

| ### VIII.iv.1.A.3.q.  When to Refer a Claim to an RO Research Coordinator |  | Prior to referring a claim to the RO Research Coordinator for additional stressor research, the development activity must first determine if a stressor can be conceded with available evidence.  Refer the claim to the RO Research Coordinator for stressor corroboration only when the<br>- required development is completed, but the claimed stressor cannot be conceded based on the stressor verification review procedures in [M21-1, Part VIII, Subpart iv, 1.A.3.d](https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018/content/554400000177468/M21-1-Part-VIII-Subpart-iv-Chapter-1-Section-A-General-Information-and-Development-for-Posttraumatic-Stress-Disorder-PTSD-Claims#3d), and<br>  <br>- claims folder contains the minimum information needed to allow for additional research as noted in [M21-1, Part VIII, Subpart iv, 1.A.3.o](https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018/content/554400000177468/M21-1-Part-VIII-Subpart-iv-Chapter-1-Section-A-General-Information-and-Development-for-Posttraumatic-Stress-Disorder-PTSD-Claims#3o).<br>  <br>**_Reference_**:  For more information on procedures for routing a PTSD claim for RO Research Coordinator review, see [M21-1, Part VIII, Subpart iv, 1.A.3.r](https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018/content/554400000177468/M21-1-Part-VIII-Subpart-iv-Chapter-1-Section-A-General-Information-and-Development-for-Posttraumatic-Stress-Disorder-PTSD-Claims#3r). |

| ### VIII.iv.1.A.4.a.  Duties of the RO Research Coordinator |  | The RO Research Coordinator is the primary point of contact within each RO for all procedures related to requests for corroboration of stressors unrelated to MST or personal trauma.    <br>The RO Research Coordinator or individual acting in the capacity of an RO Research Coordinator<br>- submits all of the RO’s requests for stressor corroboration<br>  <br>- notifies RAR when further action on a pending research request is no longer necessary, such as when evidence is received that verifies the claimed stressor or the claim is withdrawn altogether, and<br>  <br>- forwards inquiries from the RO to the Office of Field Operations VBA RAR mailbox at [VAVBAWAS/CO/OFO/RAR](mailto:RRC.VBACO@va.gov).<br>  <br>**_Note_**:  The Veterans Service Center Manager, Decision Review Operations Center Manager, or designee must notify the RAR of any changes to the employee(s) in the RO Research Coordinator role by sending an e-mail to [VAVBAWAS/CO/OFO/RAR](mailto:RRC.VBACO@va.gov).  This includes instances in which an employee is <br>- no longer serving as an RO Research Coordinator, or <br>- newly assigned the role. |

| ### VIII.iv.1.A.4.b.Criteria for Submission to RAR |  | The following general criteria must be met before the RO Research Coordinator may submit a request for corroboration of a claimed stressor to RAR:<br>- the required development is completed, but the claimed stressor cannot be conceded based on the stressor verification review procedures in [M21-1, Part VIII, Subpart iv, 1.A.3.d](https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018/content/554400000177468/M21-1-Part-VIII-Subpart-iv-Chapter-1-Section-A-General-Information-and-Development-for-Posttraumatic-Stress-Disorder-PTSD-Claims#3d), and  <br>  <br>- the claims folder contains the minimum information needed to allow additional research as described in [M21-1, Part VIII, Subpart iv, 1.A.3.o](https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018/content/554400000177468/M21-1-Part-VIII-Subpart-iv-Chapter-1-Section-A-General-Information-and-Development-for-Posttraumatic-Stress-Disorder-PTSD-Claims#3o).<br>  <br>**_Important_**: <br>- Do _not_ schedule a VA examination before receiving corroboration of the claimed in-service stressor. <br>  <br>- A diagnosis of PTSD is not a prerequisite for initiating the stressor verification process.<br>  <br>- While historically, the U.S. Army and Joint Services Records Research Center did not conduct research of all branches, RAR conducts research of stressors for all military branches.  <br>  <br>- Only RO Research Coordinators are authorized to submit stressor research requests to RAR. |

* * *

| ### VIII.iv.1.A.4.c.  Procedures for Conducting RO Research Coordinator Review |  | The table below describes the procedure for conducting RO Research Coordinator review.

| **Step** | **Action** |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Review all sources of evidence, to include records in VBA-sanctioned stressor research websites and the OMAR tool, to determine if there is credible supporting evidence that the claimed stressor occurred.<br>Can the stressor be conceded without submitting a research request to RAR?<br>- If _yes_,<br>  <br>  - annotate the claims folder as directed at [M21-1, Part VIII, Subpart iv, 1.A.1.h](https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018/content/554400000177468/M21-1-Part-VIII-Subpart-iv-Chapter-1-Section-A-General-Information-and-Development-for-Posttraumatic-Stress-Disorder-PTSD-Claims#1h), and<br>    <br>  - go to Step 5.<br>- If _no_, go to Step 2.<br>  <br>_**Note**_:  Ensure all stressor research is documented in a VBMS note, to include required research conducted in VBA-sanctioned stressor research websites and the OMAR tool.<br>**_Reference_**:  For more information on credible supporting evidence, see [M21-1, Part VIII, Subpart iv, 1.D.2.f-h](https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018/content/554400000177714/M21-1-Part-VIII-Subpart-iv-Chapter-1-Section-D-Evidence-Evaluation-and-Decisions-for-Posttraumatic-Stress-Disorder-PTSD-Claims). |
| 2 | - Submit a request for corroboration of the stressor utilizing the RECORDS RESEARCH REQUEST chevron in VBMS, and<br>  <br>- go to Step 3. <br>  <br>**_Reference_**:  For more information on using VBMS to submit requests to RAR, see<br>- [M21-1, Part III, Subpart ii, 2.D.4.b](https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018/content/554400000014116/M21-1-Part-III-Subpart-ii-Chapter-2-Section-D-Control-and-Follow-Up-of-Requests-for-Service-Records), and<br>  <br>- the _VBMS Core User Guide_. |
| 3 | Mark the _RO RESEARCH COORDINATOR REVIEW_ tracked item as received and remove the _Records Research Request_ special issue indicator, which will allow the claim to be recalled to the NWQ.<br>**_Note_**:  At this point, the RO Research Coordinator’s duties are complete for the request phase.  When a response to the request is received, go to Step 4. |
| 4 | Did the RAR response result in additional credible supporting evidence that the claimed stressor occurred?<br>- If _yes_,<br>  <br>  - annotate the claims folder as directed at [M21-1, Part VIII, Subpart iv, 1.A.1.h](https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018/content/554400000177468/M21-1-Part-VIII-Subpart-iv-Chapter-1-Section-A-General-Information-and-Development-for-Posttraumatic-Stress-Disorder-PTSD-Claims#1h), and<br>    <br>  - go to Step 5.<br>- If _no_, refer the claim to the rating activity.<br>  <br>**_Important_**:  <br>- The determination that a claimed in-service stressor cannot be corroborated is to be made based on the objective evidence of record and not the claims processor’s own personal feelings about the believability of the stressor. <br>- If the RAR response indicates that the required records are unavailable, follow the instructions in [M21-1, Part III, Subpart ii, 1.A.1.g](https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018/content/554400000014108/M21-1-Part-III-Subpart-ii-Chapter-1-Section-A-Requesting-Evidence-From-Federal-Record-Custodians). |
| 5 | Review the evidence of record to determine whether a compensation examination is warranted as detailed in [M21-1, Part VIII, Subpart iv, 1.C](https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018/content/554400000177713/M21-1-Part-VIII-Subpart-iv-Chapter-1-Section-C-Examinations-and-Medical-Opinions-for-Posttraumatic-Stress-Disorder-PTSD-Claims). |

**_Important_**:  Guidance prescribed in this block is _not_ routinely applicable in cases involving stressors related to personal trauma, including MST, as is emphasized in [M21-1, Part VIII, Subpart iv, 1.B.2.g](https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018/content/554400000177469/M21-1-Part-VIII-Subpart-iv-Chapter-1-Section-B-Development-for-Posttraumatic-Stress-Disorder-PTSD-or-Other-Claims-Related-to-Personal-Trauma).

| ### VIII.iv.1.A.4.e.  Information to Include in Requests to RAR for Stressor Corroboration |  | Military records are organized by units.  Unit records are further organized by date.  When submitting a request for stressor corroboration to RAR, include the following:<br>- Veteran’s full name and Social Security number (SSN) or VA claim number<br>  <br>- a description of the claimed stressor(s)<br>  <br>- the most specific date(s), at minimum the month and year, during which the stressful event occurred (RAR will research a period up to 120 days) <br>  <br>- the Veteran’s complete tour dates related to the unit of assignment when the event occurred<br>  <br>- the designation of the Veteran’s unit of assignment at the time of the stressful event down to the lowest possible level, and<br>  <br>- the geographic location where the stressful event took place.  In the UNIT LOCATION block, provide more concise locations such as _Fallujah, Iraq_, instead of _Iraq_, or _Seoul, Korea_, instead of just _Korea_.<br>  <br>Additional information identified by RAR as helpful in conducting research includes the<br>- medals or citations received by the Veteran, and<br>  <br>- names of other soldiers or sailors involved in the stressful event.<br>  <br>**_Important_**:<br>- For Army requests, provide the full unit designation to the company level, such as _HHC, 1st Brigade, 2d Armored Division_ (instead of _2d Armored Division_ only), and _Company C, 1st Battalion, 14th Infantry, 1st Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division_.<br>  <br>- For Navy requests, provide the full unit designation and hull numbers for ships, such as _USS Franklin D. Roosevelt (CVA-42)_ instead of _USS Roosevelt_ only.<br>  <br>- For Air Force requests, at a minimum, provide squadron and group designations, such as _366th Field Maintenance Squadron, 366th Combat Support Group_ instead of _366th Tactical Fighter Wing_ only.  Providing just the wing is insufficient because there are numerous units under a wing and various unit locations.<br>  <br>**_References_**:  For more information on <br>- personnel documents containing the Veteran’s unit(s) of assignment and service locations, see [M21-1, Part VIII, Subpart iv, 1.A.2.f](https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018/content/554400000177468/M21-1-Part-VIII-Subpart-iv-Chapter-1-Section-A-General-Information-and-Development-for-Posttraumatic-Stress-Disorder-PTSD-Claims#2f), and<br>  <br>- submitting a request to RAR, see<br>  <br>  - [M21-1, Part III, Subpart ii, 2.D.4.b](https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018/content/554400000014116/M21-1-Part-III-Subpart-ii-Chapter-2-Section-D-Control-and-Follow-Up-of-Requests-for-Service-Records), and<br>    <br>  - the _VBMS Core User Guide_. |
