Congress has recognized that Veterans who were exposed to these agents are more likely to develop certain diseases.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- If there is definitive evidence that the Veteran was **NOT** exposed to any agent orange during their service. They **_WILL_** be denied presumptive status!

  - This situation would be super unusual and highly unlikely.

* * *

## **Eligibility**

Eligibility is based upon where and when you served, as well as certain special duties:

| Location | Dates |

| American Samoa (to include territorial waters) | January 9, 1962, through July 30, 1980 |

* * *

### Additional Eligibility

  - \*\*For a list of these locations and time periods click [HERE](https://www.benefits.va.gov/compensation/docs/AO_C123_AFSpecialityCodesUnits.pdf).

* * *

### Non-Presumptive Locations

The following locations have also been recognized as having stored, destroyed, or tested Agent Orange. Do know that being assigned to these bases during the respective exposure windows does **NOT** mean the VA considers you to be presumptuously exposed. **HOWEVER**, if you served in the locations **AND** you can show that exposure was at least as likely as not likely to have happened, then the VA **CAN** concede exposure!

Examples of evidence that can show you may have been exposed include but are not limited to:

- Personnel records showing you were assigned to the location/time and having a MOS that could be linked to storing, destroying, or testing AO;

- Evaluations mentioning storing, destroying, or testing AO; and/or

- Medical records showing you sought treatment after exposure.

## **Nehmer Class Members (38 CFR 3.816)**

Eligible claimants are entitled to earlier [Effective date(s)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/edate) based on the class action lawsuit of [Nehmer v. U.S. Veterans’ Admin., 712 F. Supp. 1404 (N.D. Cal. 1989)](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/712/1404/1475736/).

Eligible conditions/benefits are to be backdated to the date the claim was initiated or date entitlement [Arose](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/edate#arose); whichever is later. In the case of eligible claims received within a year of separation, the backdate is to either the date after separation or date entitlement arose; whichever is later.

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- The limitation regarding liberalizing law (effective dates can be no earlier than the date of the law/policy change) does **NOT** apply to grants under 38 CFR 3.816!

- The appeal does **NOT** need to be continuously pursued!

- If a covered condition was later granted on [Appeal](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals) via a [Secondary](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/claimtype#secondary), [Direct](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/serviceconnection#direct), different [Presumptive](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/presumptive), etc. basis - the VA is allowed to reopen the issue and award an earlier effective date via 38 CFR 3.816.

- Claims/appeals do **NOT** need to have named Agent Orange as the basis of the condition!

  - If for example you said originally that your lung cancer was due to radiation exposure, you can still be considered a Nehmer class member.

* * *

### Eligibility

Veteran was exposed to Agent Orange and developed a covered condition _or_ their survivor claimed entitlement to a related [Death Benefit](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/deathbenefits), or [Survivor benefit](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/survivorbenefits) and was **DENIED** from September 25, 1985 to the date **BEFORE** the condition became presumptive.

- To see the list of when conditions became presumptive click [HERE](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/edate#lib).


**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- **ONLY** Veteran’s whose Agent Orange exposure happened _in_ Vietnam **_OR_** its waters (to include its waterways/ports (Brown and Blue Water Navy)) **_ARE_** subject to Nehmer! If exposure happened in a different country, Nehmer **CANNOT** be applied. [(N.D. Cal. 2020)](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/california/candce/3:1986cv06160/56297/492/)


**SPECIAL NOTE:**

- From September 25, 1985, if **ANY** claim or appeal was decided **AND** there was medical evidence of record that showed a _diagnosis_ of a condition which **BECAME** presumptive. **EVEN IF NOT AT ISSUE** in the claim/appeal, the now presumptive condition is eligible for Nehmer! (see example 3 below)


* * *

### Covered Conditions

Nehmer applies to the conditions named in [38 CFR 3.309(e)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/38/3.309) **BESIDES** chloracne. If the condition is **NOT** named in the regulation then till such time it is added officially, the Nehmer stipulation **CANNOT** be applied!

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- When a new presumptive condition is added to 38 CFR 3.309(e), the VA is **REQUIRED** to review prior decisions and grant earlier effective dates as appropriate.

  - So in theory, a person would never need to file a claim for an earlier effective date…
- By their nature, claims for conditions filed **AFTER** they became presumptive are **NOT** subject to Nehmer.

  - However, these claims are _still_ eligible for consideration under [Liberalizing law](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/edate#lib).
- Currently hypertension and MGUS are **NOT** conditions eligible for Nehmer consideration.


* * *

#### Example 1 (Nehmer Stipulation Applies)

AO Vietnam Veteran’s initial claim for lung cancer was received on October 20, 1992, and denied on December 23, 1992. Medical evidence showed a diagnosis of lung cancer in September 1992. The Veteran filed an appeal in March 2025 with evidence of the prior diagnosis.

NOTE: Lung cancer became presumptive for AO June 9, 1994.

RESULT:  SC for lung cancer is granted effective the date the initial claim was received, October 20, 1992.

* * *

#### Example 2 (Nehmer Stipulation Does **NOT** Apply)

AO Vietnam Veteran’s initial claim for diabetes was received on June 22, 1984, and denied on February 2, 1985. The Veteran filed an appeal on January 6, 2025. The earliest medical evidence showing a diagnosis of diabetes type II was in January 10, 1980.

NOTE: Diabetes became presumptive for AO May 08, 2001.

RESULT: SC for diabetes is granted January 6, 2024. Nehmer does not apply in this context as the original claim was denied **BEFORE** September 25, 1985. However, liberalizing law does still apply, as Veteran was diagnosed before the condition was presumptive.

* * *

#### Example 3 (Nehmer Stipulation Applies)

AO Vietnam Veteran files a claim for jaw pain in June 4, 2008. Medical records submitted with claim show a diagnosis of coronary artery disease dated May 10, 1999. December 5, 2020 Veteran files a claim for coronary artery disease.

NOTE: Coronary artery disease became presumptive for AO Aug 31, 2010.

RESULT: SC for coronary artery disease is granted the date a claim was made during which time there was evidence of record showing the diagnosis of the now presumptive condition, June 4, 2008.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- **MOST** raters will **MISS THIS**!

## **Frequently** **Asked Questions**

- #### I am an eligible Veteran and I was diagnosed with a listed disability, but I was denied. What can I do?






- Sometimes the VBA makes a mistake or they are missing evidence that would indicate you are an eligible Veteran with a diagnosed condition. If this happens, it is strongly recommended that you seek out the assistance of a [VSO](https://www.va.gov/ogc/apps/accreditation/index.asp) to help you file an [Appeal](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/Appeals).


Additionally,

- If there is documentation that during service the Veteran's exposure was due to their own willful misconduct or that after the Veteran's separation there was a supervening condition or event that was more than likely the etiology of the disease, the Veteran may be denied service-connection.
