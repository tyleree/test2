## **Bilateral Factor**

Bilatteral source to include: https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vamath#bilateral

Just when you thought VA math couldn't get more complicated!

If a Veteran has a rated condition (more than 0%) that affects **BOTH** the left and right sides of the **SAME** extremity half. Either upper (above the waist) or lower extremity (below the waist) then a bilateral factor is added to the VA math.

In short the bilateral conditions are given the VA math treatment and then an additional 10% is added. That number is then added back into consideration with the rest of the ratings.

### Bilateral Case Examples

![Bilateral factor shown on a human model.](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/66c515a3e8305f0f79e8b680/46a64dee-6dd7-4290-8306-3945c83633ce/bilateral+factor.png)

In the above image, you see the upper extremity half shown in a lighter shade and the lower extremity half shown in a darker shade of color.

| Example Ratings | Supporting Image | Factor (Yes/No) | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 10% each for the following disabilities: Left knee, right shoulder, and tinnitus. | ![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/66c515a3e8305f0f79e8b680/9d51af93-0e7c-47a4-836f-6d09bdf338ae/bi1.png) | No | Their are no disabilities that affect **BOTH** the left and right sides of the same extremity half. |
| 0% right ankle and 10% each for the following disabilities: Left knee, left ankle. | ![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/66c515a3e8305f0f79e8b680/d801c0ce-75a7-44cb-b7dd-d7e844cae28c/bi2.png) | No | While there are disabilities that affect both the left and right sides of the same extremity half, they **BOTH** need to be to a compensational degree (at least 10%). |
| 10% each for the following disabilities: Left knee, right ankle, right hip, and right elbow. | ![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/66c515a3e8305f0f79e8b680/b42378c7-0fd8-4d13-8e75-666497ad472a/bi3.png) | Yes/No | The factor is applied to the left knee, right ankle ratings, as well as the right hip. As the right hip falls under the lower extremity. However, the right elbow would **NOT** get the factor as the upper extremity is **NOT** affected on the left side. If it was, then they would get the factor as well. |

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- The Veteran does **NOT** need the same mirrored disability on both sides in order for the bilateral factor to apply! VA disability ratings look at whether an upper extremity (such as the shoulder, arm, or hand), or a lower extremity (such as the hip, knee, or foot) are affected by disabilities that affect both sides.

- Effective April 16, 2023, in the rare circumstances in which the bilateral factor results in the combined disability evaluation being rounded down such as from 95 to 94%. The VA will _automatically_ disable the factor of a condition, so the end result is that the combined evaluation will be 100%!

  - Veterans who were impacted by this change _should_ have been automatically reviewed and if appropriate been awarded [Dependents Educational Assistance (DEA)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/survivorbenefits#dea).

### Applying the Factor

The bilateral factor will be applied to such bilateral disabilities before other combinations are carried out and the rating for such disabilities including the bilateral factor in this section will be treated as one disability for the purpose of arranging in order of severity and for all further combinations.

For example, with disabilities evaluated at 60%, 20%, 10% and 10% (the two 10's representing bilateral disabilities), the order of severity would be 60, 21 and 20. The 60 and 21 combine to 68 and the 68 and 20 to give you 74, rounding down to 70% as the final degree of disability.

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- [Painful/unstable scars](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/skin#7804) are **NOT** eligible for bilateral consideration.

- [Deep](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/skin#7801) and [Superficial scars](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/skin#7802) **ARE** eligible for bilateral consideration so long as the ratings are **NOT**:

  - Based on whole-body involvement; or

  - Specific to the [Head, face, and/or neck](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/skin#7800).
- [Hearing](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/ears) and [Eye](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/eyes) disabilities are **NOT** eligible for bilateral consideration.

- [Cranial nerve](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/cranialnerves) conditions are **NOT** eligible for bilateral consideration.

- [Fingers](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/hands) **ARE** eligible for bilateral consideration.

- [Blood flow](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/bloodtubes) conditions involving extremities (such as varicose veins) **ARE** eligible for bilateral consideration.

- [Feet](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/foot) disabilities that have "bilateral" in the name and bilateral [Shin splints](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/kneeleg#5262) do **NOT** automatically qualify for the bilateral factor ( **IF** they are the only bilateral eligible condition of that extremity!). **HOWEVER**, if there is another separate disability eligible for bilateral factor that affects the lower extremity - the other disability **AND** the bilateral named condition **WILL** _both_ get the bilateral factor!

  - Bilateral pes planus rated at least 10% alone would **NOT** get the factor.

  - Bilateral pes planus and a right ankle condition both rated at least 10% would **BOTH** get the factor.
- To tell which conditions have an active bilateral factor, you would need to look at your codesheet.

#### VA Math Bilateral Factors Example One

Lets look back to Jeff and say instead of a 40% back rating he has a right knee rating of 10%.

| Jeff's Ratings | [Combined Ratings Table](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vamath#combined) | Jeff's Combined Total Rating (Starts at 0%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Left knee = 30% |  | 30% |
| Right knee = 10% | Row:30 Col:10 | 37% |
| Bilateral Factor (Add 10%) |  | 7% + 3.7% = 41% (The 3.7% is obtained from taking 10% of 37%. Remember to round to the nearest whole number as well) |
|  |  |  |
| Bilateral Conditions 41% |  | 41% |
| Left shoulder = 20% | Row:41 Col:20 | 53% |
| Left wrist = 10% | Row:53 Col:10 | 58% |

Jeff's Combined Rating rounds up to 60%.

#### VA Math Bilateral Factors Example Two

Now let's figure out Smith's combined rating. Smith has a several of bilateral and normal conditions: 70% mental health, 40% right shoulder, 20% left ankle, 20% right ankle, 10% right hip, 10% left foot, 10% high blood pressure, and 10% bilateral hearing loss.

| Smith's Ratings | [Combined Ratings Table](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vamath#combined) | Smith's Combined Total Rating (Starts at 0%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Left ankle = 20% |  | 20% |
| Right ankle = 20% | Row:20 Col:20 | 36% |
| Right hip = 10% | Row:36 Col:10 | 42% |
| Left foot = 10% | Row:42 Col:10 | 48% |
| Bilateral Factor (Add 10%) |  | 48% + 4.8% = 53% (The 4.8% is obtained from taking 10% of 48%. Remember to round to the nearest whole number as well) |
|  |  |  |
| Bilateral Conditions 53% |  | 53% |
| Mental health = 70% | Row:53 Col:70 | 86% |
| Right shoulder = 40% | Row:86 Col:40 | 92% |
| Bilateral hearing loss = 10% | Row:92 Col:10 | 93% |
| High blood pressure = 10% | Row:93 Col:10 | 94% |

Smith's Combined Rating rounds down to 94%.

**CLARIFICATION NOTE:**

- Yes, even if the bilateral factor _is lower_ than the first non-bilateral condition it is combined first!
