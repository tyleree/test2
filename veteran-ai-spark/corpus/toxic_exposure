# Exposure to hazardous chemicals and materials

Learn about chemical hazards or other hazardous materials you may have come in contact with during military service. And find out if you can get VA disability compensation for illnesses or conditions related to these exposures. We call these presumptive conditions.

## Medical care for volunteers involved in chemical and biological testing

As many as 60,000 Veterans volunteered for medical research for the U.S. biological and chemical programs between 1942 and 1975. You can get medical care through the U.S. Army if you volunteered for this research and have an injury or illness directly caused by your participation.

## Types of exposure

### Agent Orange

If you served in the Republic of Vietnam or in or near the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) during the Vietnam Era—or in certain related jobs—you may have had contact with Agent Orange, an herbicide used to clear plants and trees during the war.

### Asbestos

If you worked in certain military jobs, you may have had contact with asbestos (toxic fibers once used in many buildings and products).

### Birth defects like spina bifida

If you served in the Republic of Vietnam, in Thailand, or in or near the Korean DMZ during the Vietnam Era—and your child has spina bifida or certain other birth defects—your child may be eligible for disability benefits.
