Nehmer Class Members (38 CFR 3.816)
Eligible claimants are entitled to earlier Effective date(s) based on the class action lawsuit of Nehmer v. U.S. Veterans’ Admin., 712 F. Supp. 1404 (N.D. Cal. 1989).

Eligible conditions/benefits are to be backdated to the date the claim was initiated or date entitlement Arose; whichever is later. In the case of eligible claims received within a year of separation, the backdate is to either the date after separation or date entitlement arose; whichever is later.

IMPORTANT NOTES:

The limitation regarding liberalizing law (effective dates can be no earlier than the date of the law/policy change) does NOT apply to grants under 38 CFR 3.816!

The appeal does NOT need to be continuously pursued!

If a covered condition was later granted on Appeal via a Secondary, Direct, different Presumptive, etc. basis - the VA is allowed to reopen the issue and award an earlier effective date via 38 CFR 3.816.

Claims/appeals do NOT need to have named Agent Orange as the basis of the condition!

If for example you said originally that your lung cancer was due to radiation exposure, you can still be considered a Nehmer class member.

Eligibility
Veteran was exposed to Agent Orange and developed a covered condition or their survivor claimed entitlement to a related Death Benefit, or Survivor benefit and was DENIED from September 25, 1985 to the date BEFORE the condition became presumptive.

IMPORTANT NOTE:

ONLY Veteran’s whose Agent Orange exposure happened in Vietnam OR its waters (to include its waterways/ports (Brown and Blue Water Navy)) ARE subject to Nehmer! If exposure happened in a different country, Nehmer CANNOT be applied. (N.D. Cal. 2020)

SPECIAL NOTE:

From September 25, 1985, if ANY claim or appeal was decided AND there was medical evidence of record that showed a diagnosis of a condition which BECAME presumptive. EVEN IF NOT AT ISSUE in the claim/appeal, the now presumptive condition is eligible for Nehmer! (see example 3 below)

Covered Conditions
Nehmer applies to the conditions named in 38 CFR 3.309(e) BESIDES chloracne. If the condition is NOT named in the regulation then till such time it is added officially, the Nehmer stipulation CANNOT be applied!

IMPORTANT NOTES:

When a new presumptive condition is added to 38 CFR 3.309(e), the VA is REQUIRED to review prior decisions and grant earlier effective dates as appropriate.

So in theory, a person would never need to file a claim for an earlier effective date…

By their nature, claims for conditions filed AFTER they became presumptive are NOT subject to Nehmer.

However, these claims are still eligible for consideration under Liberalizing law.

Currently hypertension and MGUS are NOT conditions eligible for Nehmer consideration.

Example 1 (Nehmer Stipulation Applies)
AO Vietnam Veteran’s initial claim for lung cancer was received on October 20, 1992, and denied on December 23, 1992. Medical evidence showed a diagnosis of lung cancer in September 1992. The Veteran filed an appeal in March 2025 with evidence of the prior diagnosis.

NOTE: Lung cancer became presumptive for AO June 9, 1994.

RESULT:  SC for lung cancer is granted effective the date the initial claim was received, October 20, 1992.

Example 2 (Nehmer Stipulation Does NOT Apply)
AO Vietnam Veteran’s initial claim for diabetes was received on June 22, 1984, and denied on February 2, 1985. The Veteran filed an appeal on January 6, 2025. The earliest medical evidence showing a diagnosis of diabetes type II was in January 10, 1980.

NOTE: Diabetes became presumptive for AO May 08, 2001.

RESULT: SC for diabetes is granted January 6, 2024. Nehmer does not apply in this context as the original claim was denied BEFORE September 25, 1985. However, liberalizing law does still apply, as Veteran was diagnosed before the condition was presumptive.

Example 3 (Nehmer Stipulation Applies)
AO Vietnam Veteran files a claim for jaw pain in June 4, 2008. Medical records submitted with claim show a diagnosis of coronary artery disease dated May 10, 1999. December 5, 2020 Veteran files a claim for coronary artery disease.

NOTE: Coronary artery disease became presumptive for AO Aug 31, 2010.

RESULT: SC for coronary artery disease is granted the date a claim was made during which time there was evidence of record showing the diagnosis of the now presumptive condition, June 4, 2008.
