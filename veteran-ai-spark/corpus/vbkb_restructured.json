    "content": "## **Frequently** **Asked Questions**\n\n- #### Can my rating be reduced if taking medication or doing other treatments improve my symptoms?\n\n- **Maybe IF YOU PUT IN a claim for increase**. Yeah, that's the best answer I have gotten from speaking with several senior raters. It will come down to the rater and their judgement. Such as, if they were reduced might it cause the Veteran to return to their original degree of disability etc.\n\n- Generally, if they do decide you should be reduced, it will be by a degree of disability IE 70 to 50%. Instead of 70 to 30%.\n\n- It is recommended if you do ever receive a proposal for reduction that you **quickly** request a [Hearing](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/reduction)\n\n- #### Will my VA doctor snitch on me if I start improving?\n\n- **NO**! There are very specific circumstances in which the VHA and VBA communicate! And improving is **NOT** one of them.\n\n- Click [HERE](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/xtalk)  for details.\n\n- #### Do I have to seek treatment to maintain my rating?\n\n- No.\n\n- #### I experienced a sexual assault/rape while I was AD but I never reported it. Can I still file a claim for PTSD?\n\n- Yes, if you experienced MST during service. You may still file a claim if you never reported it. It is not at all uncommon for service members to suffer in silence. These claims will rely heavily on any evidence you can supply, such as any mental health treatment/therapy sessions, buddy statements from friends and family, etc. Do know, that even if your claim is denied, it does **NOT** mean the rater does not believe you! You might be missing a piece of the claims puzzle. As such, be sure to read your decision letter fully. It will explain what you need to do to win your claim during an [Appeal](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/)\n\n- #### I filed a claim for sleep disturbances/insomnia but my claim lumped with my other mental condition. Why?\n\n- If you have a mental health rating (outside of a eating disorder) then sleep disturbances/insomnia are considered a symptom of your mental health, even if they are caused by a physical issue such as pain. As such, it would be considered pyramiding and is not allowed.\n\n- #### Can I be rated 100% if I currently have a job?\n\n- Maybe... it will be very fact specific. Factors such as; are you full/part time, length of employment, type of employment, and is it in a [Sheltered environment](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/tdiu#sheltered)  etc.\n\n- #### Can I work if I have a 100% for mental health?\n\n- There is no restrictions with working with a 100% mental rating.\n\n- #### If I tell the C&P examiner I am suicidal will I be committed against my will?\n\n- The only time you will be committed against your will is if the examiner has reason to believe you are undergoing a mental health emergency and that you are likely to end your life in the near future. This usually is due to the examiner knowing you have a suicide plan and that you have indicated you have plans to carry them out.\n\n- #### What do I do if the VA has found I cannot handle my money?\n\n- The VA will assign you a fiduciary to handle your money. For more information click [HERE](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/)\n\n- #### Does having a rating for mental health make me ineligible for a security clearance?\n\n- No.\n\n- #### My mental diagnosis changed is that an issue?\n\n- It is not an issue. It is **SUPER** common for those in the mental health profession to have disagreements on what exactly someone's mental health diagnosis is. You cannot really blame them since mental health is **VERY** complicated. If you were service-connected for PTSD and you are now diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) then that's perfectly fine.\n\n- #### My memory is bad... can I bring notes to my exam?\n\n- Yes!\n\n- A word of caution: if you start just reading things off to match with DBQ/rating schedule the examiner might find you to be less believable. Instead, your notes should focus more-so on examples of your issues."

Even if the examiner notes there are no symptoms!\n\n- **NEVER** assign an evaluation _higher than_ moderate if symptoms cannot be tested for or seen; It does **NOT** matter if the Veteran reports severe pain!\n\n- Moderate evaluations and above require symptoms which an examiner can test for. Be it decreased sensitivity, reduced reflexes, muscle weakness/atrophy, impairment of function (shaking, slow movements, joints are stiff), and/or loss of hair growth.\n\n- Do know, even if the Veteran _does_ have a testable symptom; It does **NOT** mean that an evaluation of at least moderate is required or appropriate. There can be cases in which a mild evaluation is still the most appropriate decision.\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE:**\n\n- There can be a fair bit of differences of opinions as to how to rate nerve severity.

The number of symptoms a person who experiences epilepsy and seizures varies but can include:\n\n- Anger;\n\n- Confusion;\n\n- Drooling;\n\n- Falling down;\n\n- Fear;\n\n- Hallucinations;\n\n- Inappropriate behavior;\n\n- Mumbling;\n\n- Severe shaking of the body;\n\n- Sweating; and\n\n- Vomiting.\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTES:**\n\n- Often those who have epilepsy also have an accompanying mental disorder. If the mental disorder is only present during a seizure then the mental disorder **CANNOT** get it's own individual rating. _However_, if the [Mental disorder](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)  persists between seizures then it **CAN** get it's own individual rating!\n\n- If the above condition is meet and the mental disorder that manifests is a personality disorder. The VA will grant a rating - coding it under [Dementia](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)\n- In order for a Veteran to get a diagnosis for epilepsy the Veteran **MUST** have a seizure witnessed by a physician, **OR** verified by a physician. Verification can be done by an electroencephalogram (EEG), which measures electrical activity in the brain.\n\n**PRESUMPTIVE CONDITION:**\n\n- If diagnosed within a [Year](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/time)  of separation **AND** the severity warranted _at least_ a 10% evaluation within that time; or\n\n- [Secondary to a moderate or severe TBI](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/tbi#presumptive)"

You may need to take medication, take the day off and isolate, or seek medical attention. If medication helps, it might have the negative effect of making you too drowsy to do any work or other activities.\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTES:**\n\n- If the severity is not prostrating then you will **NOT** receive a compensational rating!\n\n- It is important that the Veteran properly document the frequency and severity of their headaches. A lot of Veterans have found the use of various headache tracking/diary apps very helpful in this regard.\n\n- You may also find using [Personal](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/personal)  or [Buddy statements](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/buddy)  helpful in showing the severity and frequency of your headaches.\n\n**PRESUMPTIVE CONDITION:**\n\n- This condition is [Presumptive](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/time)  if it is diagnosed within **1 year** of separation **AND** the severity warranted _at least_ a 10% evaluation within that time;\n\n- If exposed to [Gulf environmental hazards](https://sunflower-brass-pcgs.squarespace.com/gulfill)  and the condition is considered a MUCMI.\n\n---\n\n| Rating | Frequency of Prostrating Events |\n| --- | --- |\n| 0% | Once in 3 months or less. |\n| 10% | Once in 2 months. |\n| 30% | At least once a month. |\n| 50% | Very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability. |"

Even if the examiner notes there are no symptoms!\n\n- **NEVER** assign an evaluation _higher than_ moderate if symptoms cannot be tested for or seen; It does **NOT** matter if the Veteran reports severe pain!\n\n- Moderate evaluations and above require symptoms which an examiner can test for. Be it decreased sensitivity, reduced reflexes, muscle weakness/atrophy, impairment of function (shaking, slow movements, joints are stiff), and/or loss of hair growth.\n\n- Do know, even if the Veteran _does_ have a testable symptom; It does **NOT** mean that an evaluation of at least moderate is required or appropriate. There can be cases in which a mild evaluation is still the most appropriate decision.\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE:**\n\n- There can be a fair bit of differences of opinions as to how to rate nerve severity.

(unless special conditions are meet, see special note at bottom of schedule)\n\n- If the examiner does **NOT** test one ear (no results for one ear), the rater is instructed to assume that the untested ear is in 100% **PERFECT** working order!\n\n- In case the examiner forgets to tell you: **REMOVE** your hearing aids **BEFORE** you start the examination!\n\n- Depending on your [MOS](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/loud)  and/or [Combat](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/CombatVet)  experiences, your claim of hearing loss may be given additional weight for consideration for service-connection. Which is _not_ to say, if your MOS is not considered at high risk for noise exposure or that you did not see combat that you cannot get service connection.\n\nIn order to get a proper rating the audiologist conducting the [Examination](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/Cnp)  will conduct two tests to determine your hearing loss.\n\n- Speech discrimination - your ability to understand spoken words. Your examiner will say a word and you repeat it.\n\n- Your responses are then calculated as a percentage (higher percent, meaning better hearing).\n- Puretone audiometry test - your ability to hear tones. You will sit in a box and press a button when you hear a tone.\n\n- The tones the VA cares about are 4000, 3000, 2000, and 1000Hz. The results from those tones (how loud the tone had to be before you heard it) are then added together and divided by 4 to give you your average. The lower the number is, the better your hearing is.\n\n**PRESUMPTIVE CONDITION:**\n\n- Hearing loss is considered a [Presumptive condition](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/time)  if it manifests within _one year_ of separation, **AND** the severity warranted _at least_ a 10% evaluation within that time.\n\nNOTE:\n\n- If you have disabilities that make it impossible/difficult to complete the speech discrimination test you will be rated based on just the puretone test results."

This is undoubtedly the most complicated system devised to rate a condition.\n\nThere are three different ways to rate visual impairment:\n\n1. [Central Visual Acuity](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/eyes#central)\n\n2. [Visual Field](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/eyes#field)\n\n3. [Muscle Dysfunction](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/eyes#muscle)\n\nAnd since we know Veterans can be impaired in more than one measure:\n\n- [Muscle Dysfunction and Central Visual Acuity](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/eyes#mc)\n\n- [Muscle Dysfunction and Visual Field](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/eyes#mv)\n\n- [Muscle Dysfunction, Central Visual Acuity, and Visual Field](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/eyes#all)\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTES:**\n\n- If an eye has a condition that affects muscle dysfunction _and_ central visual acuity or visual field. The Veteran will **NOT** get a separate rating for muscle dysfunction. Instead, the Veteran's visual rating(s) could be increased.\n\n- If only one eye is affected and the other eye is _VA_ normal (at least 20/40 corrected vision), then the combined rating of both visual acuity and visual field (including any increase from muscle function) the visual impairment rating for the eye **CANNOT** be higher than 30%! This does **NOT** include other possible eye condition ratings.\n\n- If only one eye is service-connected for visual impairment. The other eye for rating purposes is considered to be at 20/40.\n\n- **UNLESS**, the service-connected **AND** non-service-connected eye has a visual acuity of 20/200 or less; **OR** the peripheral field of vision for each eye is 20 degrees or less. Then the non-service connected eye **WILL** be considered service-connected for rating purposes."

It runs on the familiar 20/20 scale. So the worse the vision is, the smaller the number. e.g. 20/100 (0.2) is worse than 20/50 (0.4).\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTES:**\n\n- Your rating is based upon **CORRECTED DISTANCE VISION**. So if your distance vision is more or less good in _both_ eyes with glasses... well enjoy your low rating.\n\n- Again, for the purposes of the VA, normal vision is 20/40. If you only have one eye examined and not the other. The rater is instructed to assume that eye is normal. Barring of course a note stating the Veteran is missing said eye."

They can be a negative or positive number, depending how your vision is being corrected. If the difference in diopter numbers between both eyes are _greater_ than three (e.g. -5.0 to get a corrected vision of 20/40 and -1.5 to get a corrected vision of 20/20).

The Veteran's rating will be increased by 10% (real math, not [VA math](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vamath)  Though, the rating cannot exceed 100%.\n\n- This is permitted in conjunction with a rating for [Disfigurement](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/skin#7800)  However the disfigurement rating can then **NOT** be based upon gross distortion or asymmetry of the eye. But it still **CAN** be rated based on other characteristics of disfigurement."

You actually have to have a treatment preformed. So, if they refuse to treat you or you refuse treatment for whatever reason. That visit will not count as an incapacitating episode.\n- Treatments may include but are not limited to:\n\n- Immunosuppressant or biologic agents\n\n- Injections into the eye area\n\n- Laser treatments\n\n- Surgeries\n\n| Rating | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| 10% | 1-2 episodes a year. |\n| 20% | 3-4 episodes a year. |\n| 40% | 5-6 episodes a year. |\n| 60% | 7 or more episodes a year. |"

    "content": "### Example: Calculating Estimated Skin Surface Area and Percentages of Total Body\n\n1\\. Identify which area(s) of skin are affected.\n\n- In the above example:\n\n- Front of Torso and Genitalia are affected.\n\n2\\. Shape off sections of affected skin, so you can measure the area. If the area has does not allow for a single square/rectangle/triangle. Then you will need to make several shapes to get a more accurate estimate.\n\n3\\. Find the area of your shapes. Time to take off your socks and do some math! Measure the area(s) of the affected skin.\n\n- In our pictured example:\n\n- Front of Torso is 7\"x8\" so area is 56 in².\n\n- Genitalia is 5\"x5\" so area is 25 in².\n\n**Math Reminders**\n\n- Square and rectangles: width times length.\n\n- Right angle triangle: width times length then divide the area by 2.\n\n- So if the length and width are 2\" and 5\" multiply to get an area of 10 in² _then_ divide the area by 2 to get a final area of 5 in².\n\n4\\. Add your areas per body section If your skin condition is made up of multiple shapes, add those areas together per [Body section](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/skin#estimate)\n\n- In our pictured example:\n\nWe did not have multiple areas of the same body sections affected. So no work for us to do here.\n\n- Total Front of Torso: 56 in².\n\n- Total Genitalia: 25 in².\n\n5\\. Calculate total area of _exposed skin_ Remember, the body sections considered exposed are:\n\n- Front of Head;\n\n- Back of Head;\n\n- Front of Neck;\n\n- Back of Neck;\n\n- Back of Hand/Fingers; and\n\n- Palm of Hand/Fingers.\n\n**Add** up the areas of all exposed body sections then **divide** by **368in** ². Now multiply that answer by **100** to get a percentage of exposed skin that is affected.\n\nIf your combined exposed area was 120 in². We would do 120/368 to get 0.3260. Then multiply 0.3260 by 100 to get 32.60%.\n\nGiving us a total area of exposed skin of 32.6%.\n\n- However, in our pictured example: We did not have any areas of exposed skin.\n\n6\\. Calculate total area of affected skin\n\n**Add** up all the areas of all body sections then **divide** by **2636in** ². Now multiply that answer by **100** to get a percentage of total skin that is affected.\n\n- In our pictured example:\n\n- Total Front of Torso: 56 in² + Total Genitalia: 25 in² = 81 in²\n\n- 81 in² /2636 in² = 0.0307 times 100 = 3.07%\n\n- Percentage of Total Body affected is 3.07%\n\nWith the percentages of total body and possibly exposed skin. You can now use the [General rating formula](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/skin#general)  to determine your rating."

(Some Veterans get confused about this, because Social Security does have this requirement.)\n\n- #### Can My Disability Ratings be Lowered if my Disabilities Improve Due to Medications, other Treatments, or Surgeries?\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE:**\n\n- In **MOST** cases, unless you file a new claim for increase, the VA will **NOT** just come looking at your previously rated conditions!\n\n**CONTINUOUS Medication Usage:**\n\n- If the schedule specifically mentions medication usage - the Veteran will be rated as stated. This generally results in the Veteran getting a higher rating.\n\n- If the schedule does **NOT** mention medication usage - so long as the Veteran continues to take their medication they should **NOT** be reduced!

    "content": "## **Frequently** **Asked Questions**\n\n- #### How long will it take for my claim to finish?\n\n- Claim completion time varies from a few weeks to over a year. This depends on several factors:\n\n- The type of claim you filed.\n\n- How many injuries or disabilities you claimed and how complex they are.\n\n- How long it takes the VA to collect the evidence needed to decide your claim.\n\n- The availability of examiners in your area for the type of examination(s) you require.\n- To see what the current average time it takes to complete a claim click [HERE](https://www.benefits.va.gov/reports/mmwr_va_claims_online.asp)\n\n- #### How do I check the status of my claim?\n\n- You can check the status of your claim [HERE](https://www.va.gov/claim-or-appeal-status/)  However, we do **NOT** recommend you constantly check as your claim can and **WILL** go back and forth in the steps\n\n- You can also check your status via the [VA Claim Tracking App](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/va-claim-tracker/onbanekcefgnibhlaiimeadkbdahjpoo)\n\n- #### Can the VA work my claim during the weekend/holidays?\n\n- Yes.\n\n- #### What do I do while I wait?!\n\n- Try and take up a hobby to fill up your time and head instead of constantly checking and worrying about your claim.\n\n- #### I have evidence to submit in support of my claim but I don't want to mail/fax evidence!\n\n- Not a question.... But you **CAN** submit evidence via the [Quick submit portal](https://eauth.va.gov/accessva/?cspSelectFor=quicksubmit)  online.\n\n- #### The VA website/App is down!?\n\n- It is not uncommon for the VA to do maintenance on the weekends.\n\n- #### Can I use a lawyer or claims agent to help me file a new claim?\n\n- Yes, accredited attorneys and claims agents can help you. However, since they **CANNOT** charge you a percentage of your back pay for new claims, they typically only become involved on appeals (after a claim has been denied).\n\n- #### What should I do if I disagree with my claim's decision?\n\n- If you disagree with your claim's decision (all or parts) you can [Appeal](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals)  the decision. You have up to one year to appeal the decision and still preserve the initial \"intent to file\" [Effective date](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/edate)  of the claim.\n\n- #### Can I file for a secondary condition if the primary condition is not yet service-connected?\n\n- Yes, so long as the primary condition is either filed within the same claim, is currently undecided in another claim, _or_ is currently undecided in an appeal.\n\n- #### The CD I got from medical is password protected, I don't remember the password?\n\n- Try the last four of your social security number and the first three letters of your first name in lowercase.\n\n- #### If I file an new claim/increase, can the VA reduce my ratings?\n\n- Yes, by filing a claim you invite the VA to review your file. If it is found that a [Clear and Unmistakable Error](https://www.reddit.com/r/VeteransBenefits/wiki/appeals/#wiki_clear_and_unmistakable_error_.28cue.29)  occurred and you were rated either too high or that service-connection was granted in error, the VA WILL start action to fix the error! Further, if exams show your condition(s) have improved, the VA _can_ start action to reduce you!\n\n- Do know that the rater will stick to the path for the most part. Meaning, if you file for say your right knee, they are not gonna be poking around unrelated ratings like your mental health or shoulder.\n\n- #### If I file a claim secondary to something, will the VA automatically reevaluate the primary condition?\n\n- Not always. If you do not indicate in your claim or in any statements that the primary condition has worsened the VA **SHOULD** _not_ evaluate the primary condition. However, in practice this is not always followed.\n\n- #### Do I need to resubmit evidence that I provided for a previous claim/appeal?\n\n- No, evidence provided to the VA stays in your permanent file and can be freely accessed for use in new claims.\n\n- #### If I was seen by a civilian doctor in-service are those records considered Service Treatment Records?\n\n- Yes. Do know that TriCare may not have received all of those medical records so you should either supply those records to the VA or sign the [Release](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/vba-21-4142-are.pdf)  to allow the VA to obtain them for you.\n\n- #### If an injury occurred while I was on leave can I get service-connection?\n\n- So long as the injury was not the result of gross-misconduct, certainly!\n\n- #### I just got granted/denied an increase claim, is there a set time I must wait before filing another increase claim?\n\n- No, you can file right away.\n\n- #### Can I file multiple claims/appeals at once?\n\n- Yes, you can file multiple claims/separate appeals at the same time.\n\nNOTES:\n\n- If you file additional claims while a previous claim is still being processed the new claim **WILL BE** closed administratively and merged with the prior claim. This merging does **NOT** allow those later conditions to be considered received with the older claim - merely that they are processed together.\n\n- You **CANNOT** file multiple appeals for the **_SAME_** _issue_ at the **SAME** time.\n\n- #### If I have a claim and appeal(s) open at the same time can the VA rate them together?\n\n- Generally speaking, the rater can rate them at the same time - assuming both are ready to be rated at the same time and that there is no [Jurisdictional](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/jurisdiction)  conflict.\n\n- #### Will filing a new claim slow down any active appeals I have?\n\n- No, each appeal is processed separately from all other claims/appeals.\n\n- #### Will filing additional claims slow my current claim down?\n\n- Maybe:\n\n- If you are in line to get before a rater it will kick it out of line and back to [Step 2](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/stages)\n\n- If you were in steps 3 or 4 then no real loss in terms of speed.\n\n- #### My claim closed for NO REASON!?\n\nThis generally happens for 1 of 4 reasons:\n\n1. You had an active claim already open. Va will merge the new with the old.\n\n2. You filed an appeal on the wrong form (you were previously denied).\n\n3. You do not have any period(s) of service the VA can consider as [Honorable for VA purposes](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/upgrade)\n\n4. Va is big dumb and closed it in error thinking 2 applied.\n\nBonus 5th option: website just a buggy mess, give it a day or 2.\n\nIf you think it was closed in error consider making a [VERA appointment](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vera)  and ask them to look under the hood.\n\n- #### Can I claim multiple theories of service-connection (direct, secondary, presumptive) at the same time?\n\n- Yes! You are not expected to be a medical professional and know exactly what caused your issue. So there is no harm in presenting multiple theories to the VA at the same time.\n\n- #### Can I claim something as secondary to multiple conditions at the same time?\n\n- Yes."

    "content": "# **Filing an Appeal**\n\n[\n\n---\n\nIf you do **NOT** agree with your claim's decision, you may file an appeal. Just like [Filing a claim](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vaclaim)  you _may_ use the assistance of a [VSO](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vso)  lawyer, or an accredited claims agent.\n\nThere are three initial different methods to appeal:\n\n1. Higher-Level Review;\n\n2. Supplemental claim; or\n\n3. Board of Veteran Appeals (BVA).\n\nIf your appeal is denied again you **CAN** try another eligible option (see applicable notes).\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTES:**\n\n- If you want to keep your [Effective date](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/edate)  (your back pay) you **MUST** file an appeal within **one year** of your claim's decision date! Veterans who fail to do that can only get their original effective date and back pay if there is a [Clear and Unmistakable Error (CUE)](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals#cue)\n\n- Lawyers and claims agents **CANNOT** charge more than **33.3%**\\\\* (excluding expenses\\*\\*) of the Veteran's back pay. Further, they can _only_ get paid if/when the Veteran wins their appeal. Again, VSOs are a resource that is free to the Veteran.\n\n- **PICK A LANE**! You **CANNOT** file multiple appeals/methods for the _same issue_ at the same time ( _without_ first withdrawing the current appeal)!\n\n- If you filed an appeal to BVA and are tired of waiting you **CANNOT** then file a supplemental claim while the BVA case is pending for the _same issues_.\n\n- Likewise, you **CANNOT** file an HLR and supplemental claim for the same issue at the same time, etc.\n\n- You **CAN** file an HLR for [Hearing loss](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/ears)  and a supplemental claim for a [Back](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/spine)  issue at the same time - since they are _different issues_.\n\n- **EXCEPTION:**\n\n- If you have an appeal in at a court above BVA you **_CAN_** then have a separate appeal open for the same issue (just can't go immediately back to the previous lower court).\n\n\\*The VA will only pay up to 20% automatically from the back pay. If the agreement is over 20% then, the Veteran will need to pay the difference to the lawyer themselves.\n\n\\*\\*Expenses can be things like postage, travel costs, or printing supplies."

If your claim has a CUE it is possible to still get that back pay.\n\nCUEs are **EXTREMELY** fact specific as such it is **STRONGLY** advised that the Veteran seek out an experienced VSO or lawyer to help them! If the Veteran makes an error in their filing the VA does **NOT** have a duty to assist them in the cases of CUEs. As such the CUE may be wasted.\n\nCUEs are **NOT** a matter of a difference in opinion. CUEs involve errors that **CANNOT** be debated and must be such, that a _reasonable person_ would agree that the VA messed up.\n\nCUEs must be based upon evidence that was available to the VA at the time the decision was made. The Veteran **CANNOT** assert that later evidence or evidence that was not given to the VA proved that the Veteran should have been given a favorable decision!\n\nFurther, CUEs **MUST** be considered in the realm of what the laws/regulations/policies were _at the time they were decided_. Veterans **CANNOT** try to apply current laws/regulations/policies to decisions that were made prior to them!\n\nIn order to invoke a CUE the Veteran **MUST** state a CUE has occurred _AND_ **MUST** specify the factual or legal error(s) at issue.\n\n**Seriously, get help!**\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTES:**\n\n- You only get **_ONE_** shot at a CUE per issue. That's it! If you pick something that isn't a CUE and you look back and 'gosh, oh shoot this other thing is the CUE!' That is it. Thanks for playing!\n\n- [Duty to Assist](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/dta)  errors can **NEVER** be the basis of a CUE; as only evidence of record at the time of the prior decision can be considered.\n\n- CUEs are a knife that **CAN** cut both ways! Meaning these errors getting corrected **CAN** end up hurting or helping you. It is common for raters to find multiple additional CUEs when you declare a CUE; since a rater who already made at least 1 CUE is generally just gonna mess everything else up!\n\n- CUEs **CANNOT** sever service-connection for conditions that have been service-connected for at least 10 years (barring findings of the grant itself having no legal basis or fraud).\n\n- If [Secondary](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/claimtype#secondary)  service-connection is granted for a condition **AND** the condition it is secondary to is severed, then the VA will then propose to sever the secondary conditions - assuming there are no other routes to grant them service-connection.\n- CUEs **CANNOT** reduce an evaluation held for at least 20 years.\n- Forgotten claims (conditions not rated) and missed issues (conditions that should have been inferred or ancillary benefits that were overlooked) are **NOT** CUEs! While they are certainly administrative errors, they are _not_ CUEs because the VA has not erred in making a decision one way or the other.\n\n- Generally forgotten and missed issues/benefits **CAN** be granted **WITH** back dated effective dates! You just need to point out in the claim/appeal that the VA failed to rate the issues in the previous decision and **EXPLAIN** why the VA should have considered it or that you meet the criteria of a grant previously and the VA failed to grant.\n\n- Commonly missed ancillary benefits are things like [Special Monthly Compensation (SMC)](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/smc)  and [Chapter 35](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/survivorbenefits#dea)\n\n- Commonly missed inferred conditions are things like [Residual scars](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/skin#7802)  and secondary [Nerve issues](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/nerveindex)  due to a [Spine](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/spine)  condition.\n\n- NOTE: Inferring issues became policy circa 2014. So missed inferred issues prior to this year **CANNOT** be considered.\n- The VA does not have a form for forgotten claims or CUES; So you can file via a [Personal statement](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/personal)  or on a [(20-0995)](http://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-20-0995-ARE.pdf)  to help the VA with keeping track of the claim."

    "content": "## **Frequently** **Asked Questions**\n\n- #### How do I check the status of my appeal?\n\n- You can check the status of your appeals on [VA.gov](http://va.gov/)  by calling 1 (800) 827-1000, or making a [VERA appointment](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vera)\n\n- #### I filed my HLR/Supplemental claim via QuickSubmit and it has not shown up online yet?\n\n- It can take a week or two before it will show up online.\n\n- #### My appeal shows closed but my conditions are still unchanged. Have I been denied?\n\n- It is possible, however the VA websites often do not update everything at the same time. So give it another day.\n\n- Alternatively, if you filed an HLR. If an error was found that required the VA to obtain new evidence then your HLR will be administratively closed and re-opened as a supplemental claim.\n\n- #### You mentioned other power/authority DROs have?\n\n- In addition to the ability to issue differences of opinions: DROs are allowed to declare CUEs (that do not harm the vet) without getting another person to approve their determination.\n\n- #### During my HLR the VA found a duty to assist error and are sending me to another C&P exam. Can I now submit additional evidence, if I have some?\n\n- Yes, your appeal has now become a supplemental claim. So you are free to [Submit](https://eauth.va.gov/accessva/?cspSelectFor=quicksubmit)  any new and relevant evidence to your claim.\n\n- #### How do I change review options at the Board?\n\n- Fill out a new Board Appeal form. Make sure you check the box for the new review option, and list all of the issues.\n\n- **IMPORTANT:** You have **one year** from the date on the decision, or **60 days** from the date that you submitted your Board Appeal, whichever is later to make this change!\n\n- #### How do I request different Board review options for different issues?\n\n- You can submit one Board Appeal form and attach additional pages to explain how you want your issues reviewed, or you can submit multiple Board Appeal forms \"“ one for each review option.\n\n- #### I lost my BVA appeal, what can I do now?\n\n- If you disagree with the Board's decision and have new and relevant evidence that supports your case, you can file a Supplemental Claim. You can also appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims.\n\n- #### How do I change my appeal from a Board Appeal to Supplemental Claim or Higher-Level Review?\n\n- Tell the Board in writing that you wish to withdraw your Board Appeal. Then you can file a Supplemental Claim or Higher-Level Review.\n\n- #### Should I hire an attorney/claims agent?\n\n- That is a personal decision. However, unless your appeal hangs on a certain legal issue/angle then the benefit they provide may not be there.\n\n- #### Can I file an appeal a specific condition decision, or do I have to appeal the entire claim?\n\n- You can appeal a single decision, two, all of them, etc. Do know you **CANNOT** appeal the same condition via multiple appeal types at the same time!\n\n- #### On the supplemental claim form, what does \"Check this box if any issue listed below is being withdrawn from the legacy appeals process. OPT-IN from SOC/SSOC\"?\n\n- This box only applies to Veterans who are wanting to convert their 'legacy appeal' to the modern appeal processes. In short, unless you have been in a continuous appeal since circa 2017, this box does **NOT** apply to you and **CAN** be ignored.\n\n- #### If I file an appeal, can the VA reduce my ratings?\n\n- Yes, by filing an appeal you invite the VA to review your file. If it is found that a Clear and Unmistakable Error occurred and you were rated either too high or that service-connection was granted in error, the VA **WILL** start action to fix the error! That said, a mere difference of opinion is **NOT** enough! Further, if exams are ordered as apart of you claim and it is found that your condition(s) have improved, the VA _can_ start action to reduce you!\n\n- #### Will I need to resubmit evidence that I previously submitted?\n\n- No, the VA permanently keeps **ALL** records they receive.\n\n- #### Will my pay be paused while the VA works on my appeal?\n\n- Your pay will continue as appropriate, during the appeals process.\n\n- #### Can I file multiple appeals on a single supplemental or HLR form?\n\n- Yes.\n\n- #### Will filing an appeal slow down any active claims/appeals I have?\n\n- No, each appeal is processed separately from all other claims/appeals.\n\n- In the event a separate appeal/claim hinges on the out outcome of its sister, then just the entangled issue(s) will be held in a waiting pattern till the primary issue is decided.\n\n- #### Can I use a BVA case as evidence to support my own appeal?\n\n- No, BVA cases do **NOT** establish precedence, only CAVC courts and higher do. However, you can try and use arguments presented in those cases.\n\n- #### If I file a supplemental claim will I get new exam(s)?\n\n- It is typical to get new exams or [Medical opinions](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/imo)  when you file a supplemental. However, if your appeal does not properly address the rationale for the denial it may be found not appropriate to order you exams/opinions.\n\n- #### My attorney/claim agent told me NOT TO TALK to the VA and that all communication needs to go through them?\n\n- This is generally **VERY BAD** advice and serves more to drag out the length of an appeal (more money for them) than it would help you.\n\n- Further the VA will **NOT** honor a request for \"exclusive contact\" wherein the VA is prohibited from contacting the Veteran. You can of course refuse to respond/speak with the VA, as is your right - but you may find it best to answer questions as appropriate, especially if they are for the purposes of clarification."

    "content": "### Eligibility\n\nThere are three kinds of burial allowances: Non-Service Connected (NSC), Service-Connected (SC) and Death Under Care. Burial benefits are made up of the burial allowance itself, Plot benefits, and Transportation benefit.\n\nNot every Veteran's survivors are entitled to a Burial allowance. If your Veteran was not in receipt of benefits at death, did not have a pending claim at death, or did not pass away under care, the claim for Burial benefits will very likely be denied.\n\n- **NSC Death**: This is VA's version of the [Social Security $255 Lump Sum Death Benefit](https://www.ssa.gov/forms/ssa-8.html)  The Veteran had to have been in receipt of benefits at the time of death ( [Compensation](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vaclaim)  or [Pension](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/pension)\n\n- The current _Maximum_ Burial Allowance is $978 and $978 for a plot.\n- **SC Death**: This is VA's burial decision indicating that the Veteran's death was somehow tied to their military service. The biggest driver of this is the combination of issues that the Veteran was rated for during their lifetime and the published cause of death on the death certificate. If you select SC Burial as an option on the application and that link is **NOT** obvious, you will get a letter asking you to provide scientific or medical evidence.\n\n- The _Maximum_ Burial allowance is $2,000.\n\n- Alternatively, if the Veteran is buried in a VA national cemetery - the whole costs of moving the remains _may_ be covered.\n- **Death Under Care**: Those not in receipt can only be awarded Burial benefits if they died under care. Dying under care is an unofficial catch-all to describe death that happens at or in transit to/from a Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC), death at a State Veterans Home, or death at a contract nursing home. The nursing home that a Veteran deceased at would have been arranged by the local VAMC to qualify as death under care.\n\n- The current _Maximum_ Burial Allowance is $978 and $978 for a plot."

While it is important to go over this to-do list to help prevent over payments (debts) - if you need a few days to catch a breath and decompress before moving on, take them! Just try to get to it within a month of death.\n\nHopefully, death didn't come suddenly and without warning like an _ACME_ _anvil_ from above - but even if it did you will be able to get through these difficult times."

What bills were they responsible for and still need to be paid?\n\n- Car, house, utilities, etc.\n\n- **IMPORTANT NOTE:**\n\n- You are **NOT** required to accept the debt of the departed (if you are not party to the debt). Meaning if you did not co-sign things then the debt is (generally) owed just by the Veteran's estate. So if they had a mountain of credit card debt you do **NOT** have to assume the debt!\n- If Veteran received VA [Disability](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vaclaim)  or [Pension](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/pension)  benefits:\n\n- Contact the VA at 1-800-827-1000.\n- If Veteran received Social Security benefits:\n\n- Contact your local Social Security office at 1-800-772-1213.\n\n- Surviving spouse, ask about your eligibility for increased benefits. Also, check on benefits that any _minor_ children may be entitled to receive.\n- If Veteran retired from the military:\n\n- Contact Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) at 1-800-538-9552.\n\n- Contact Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) at 1-888-332-7411.\n- If Veteran retired or was working (employed when they died) from/at a Federal Civil Service job:\n\n- Contact the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) at 1-888-767-6738.\n- If Veteran was working:\n\n- Contact their employer for information on pension plans and any death benefits.\n- Contact their health insurance provider regarding terminating coverage for the deceased while continuing coverage for yourself/others covered through the policy.\n\n- Contact their life insurance compan(ies) for all their life insurance policies.\n\n- You will generally need to provide the policy number and a certified copy of the death certificate and fill out a claim form.\n\n- If the deceased is listed as the beneficiary on any other policy, arrange to have their name removed.\n\n- If the Veteran was enrolled in the Servicemember's Group Life Insurance plan (SGLI), Veteran's Group Life Insurance (VGLI), or Family SGLI (FSGLI) call the VA at 1-877-832-4943.\n\n- If the Veteran was enrolled in other VA policies such as Service-Disabled Veterans Insurance (S-DVI) and VALife call the VA at 1-800-669-8477.\n- Banking/Investments:\n\n- Change any joint bank accounts into just your name.\n\n- If the deceased's estate is in trust, check with the Trust Department or Customer Service at the bank.\n\n- Contact the banks/companies that held their investments to have assets transferred.\n- If the deceased owned a car, transfer the automobile title into your name at the Secretary of State's Office, or if the estate is probated, through Probate Court.\n\n- Seek the advice of an accountant or tax advisor about filing the deceased's tax return for the year of the death. Keep monthly bank statements on all individual and joint accounts that show the account balance on the day of death, since you will need this information for the estate tax return."

The annuity is based on a percentage of retired pay and **IS** an inflation-adjusted!\n\nPremiums for SBP coverage are taken from pre-tax retiree pay; which saves you money (vs. paying from post-tax). The average premium are well below the cost for a conventional insurance policy so for most retirees, SBP is a good choice.\n\nThe maximum SBP annuity payment for a spouse is 55% of the member's retired pay (or in the case of a member who retires under REDUX, the retired pay the member would have received if under the high-three retirement system). However, a smaller amount may be elected.\n\nEligible children may also be SBP beneficiaries, either alone or added to spouse coverage. In the latter case, the children receive benefits only if the spouse dies or otherwise becomes ineligible to receive the annuity. Eligible children equally divide a benefit that is 55% of the member's elected base amount. Child coverage is relatively inexpensive because children get benefits only while they are considered eligible dependents.\n\nCoverage is also available for a former spouse or, if the retiree has no spouse or children, for an \"insurable interest\" (such as a business partner or parent).\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE:**\n\n- Surviving spouses maintain their eligibility until death, as long as they do **NOT** remarry before the age of 55. If the spouse remarries before age 55, payments will stop!\n\n- However, if the marriage later ends for _any_ reason, their eligibility for the annuity is returned and just needs to be [Managed](https://www.dfas.mil/RetiredMilitary/survivors/manage/)"

Asking the VA to decide your claim fulfills the 5103 notice requirement. In effect saving you from having to wait a month, whenever someone at the VA realizes no one ever sent the notice out.\n\nSo yes, for those who say it does nothing... You are right in the _vast majority_ of cases."

    "content": "# **Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD)**\n\n[\n\n---\n\n[Employment](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/#ee)\n\nIf you are between **180-90 days** _before_ separation you can file a BDD claim within that window of time.\n\nIdeally, this will allow your claim to get a head-start and get you a decision the day after you separate - but\"¦ this is _not_ always the case.\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTES:**\n\n- You **MUST** submit your Service Treatment Records (STRs) **NO LATER THAN 90 DAYS BEFORE** you separate from Active Duty. Failure to do so **WILL** result in your claim being removed from the BDD program! Specifically, the VA is requires your _Separation Health Assessment - Part A Self-Assessment (SHA, Part A)_.\n\n- Private medical records (treatment outside a military provider) is generally **NOT** included into your STRs unless **YOU** have them added. Ask your base medical how they want to go about this. They should accept copies of those records or have a fax number the providers can send your records to.\n\n- You can obtain your STRs [HERE](https://patientportal.mhsgenesis.health.mil/)\n\n- You can upload evidence via this [LINK](https://eauth.va.gov/accessva/?cspSelectFor=quicksubmit)\n- If some records are missing/incomplete that is fine - just submit what you can for now!\n- You do **NOT** need to attend all your exams before the window closes or even before you separate.\n\n- **ALWAYS** keep the VA updated of your location! That way they can properly notify you any [Examinations](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/#cnp)\n\n- BDD claims **CANNOT** have ratings finalized till the day **AFTER** you officially separate from active duty!\n\n- If you had a previous period of service and had claimed condition(s) denied, you **MUST** file an appropriate [Appeal](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals)  to re-claim those denied issues!\n\n- If you decide to file for additional conditions when you are _under 90 days_ to separation, a separate claim **WILL** be created while the BDD continues as a BDD claim!\n\n- Intents to file mean **NOTHING** for a BDD claim as the effective date of any grants **CANNOT** be earlier than the day **AFTER** you separate from the military.\n\n**RATER NOTES:**\n\n- Seriously, if you have **NOT** been seen in-service for your claimed condition(s) it is **CRITICAL**that you file **_BEFORE_** you separate! It **WILL GREATLY** help you in getting [Service-connection](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/serviceconnection)  So even if it might delay you getting a decision it **WILL GREATLY** help you in the end!\n\n- Seriously, the bar to get service-connection gets **NO LOWER** than when you file a claim while **STILL ON ACTIVE DUTY**! In short, in **MOST** cases so long as you can get a _current diagnosis_ you will get service-connection!\n\nNOTES:\n\n- BDD claims _are_ given [Priority](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/fast)  in terms of claims processing.\n\n- All conditions will be considered under [Primary service-connection](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/serviceconnection)  even if they are factually due to another condition.\n\n- Unless there is clear and unmistakable evidence the condition was preexisting, then the VA will consider under [Aggravation](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/agg)"

    "content": "## **Frequently** **Asked Questions**\n\n- #### When is the VA going to order my exams!?\n\n- Really hard to say, depending on local conditions (how backed up examiners are), it can take beyond your separation date. But ideally, you should have your exams sorted out within two months of filing.\n\n- #### How long will it be before my claim is rated?\n\n- The million dollar question! Ideally, the VA would have your rating ready to go, the day after you separate. However, it rarely happens that way. Realistically, you should get a decision in one-three months after separation.\n\n- #### Who gave the VA a time machine! My claim status shows a date in the future?\n\n- The date shown is the date after you separate from the military. This is because your [Effective date](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/edate)  cannot be any earlier.\n\n- #### Do I have to explain how I developed a condition?\n\n- No, when you joined the military you did so with a presumption of soundness - meaning you were 100% healthy (barring anything brought up at MEPS). So the fact something popped up while you were in service means you are good to go (unless it is something the VA will [NOT service connect](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/NoRate)\n\n- #### My separation date changed! Do I need to do anything?\n\n- Call the VA (1-800-827-1000) and let them know whats is going on, as a courtesy.\n\n- #### Whoops, looks like I am just gonna stay in the military. Do I need to do anything?\n\n- Yes! Submit a [Personal statement](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/personal)  explaining the situation. Failure to do so _may_ result in a debt being created - if the VA starts paying you!\n\n- #### The website is not letting me submit a claim online! I get a message to contact the VA and the phone people are not able to help me!\n\n- Looks like you ran into a technical issue (welcome to the VA!). If the VA is unable to sort this issue out and your BDD window is closing fast you should submit your claim via a [VSO](https://veteransbenefitskb.com//vso)  or via fax: 844-531-7818.\n\n- #### I am in the National Guard/Reserves can I file a BDD claim?\n\n- Yes, if you are on Active Duty or Title 32 orders (and you are in the BDD window) - you **CAN** file a BDD claim.\n\n- #### Oh no! VA sent me a letter saying they were removeing me from the BDD program!\n\n- Your claim will continue but without the benefit of BDD priority.\n\n- #### I am almost separated but no exams! What is wrong!?\n\n- Some locations are more backed up than others. So sometimes you may not be able to get all your exams done till after you separate. This will **NOT** remove you from the BDD program!\n\n- #### Should I submitted personal and buddy statements?\n\n- You really do not need to. If you really wanted to, it would generally be helpful with respect to talking about the severity of a condition.\n\n- The following links has information on statements:\n\n- [Personal Statements](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/personal)\n\n- [Buddy Statements](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/buddy)\n\n- #### I forgot to claim something. Can't I just talk to my examiner about it and the VA can grant?\n\n- Certainly talk to your examiner about **ALL** your issues! But know the VA _generally_ **CANNOT** grant things without you formally claiming them!\n\n- In most cases it will be best to formally file claims for those additional conditions (sooner than later).\n\n- #### The rating schedule changed between the time I filed my BDD claim and separation; what rating schedule will I be rated under?\n\n- You will be rated under the rating schedule in effective the day **AFTER** you separate.\n\n- If the rating schedule changed while you were on Active Duty then you **WILL** be rated under the new schedule.\n\n- If the rating schedule changed _2 days or more_ **AFTER** you separate, then you'd be considered under _both_ schedules (assuming a decision wasn't made exactly on the day after you separated):\n\n- If the new schedule is better you'd be rated under the old schedule till the new schedule became effective.\n\n- If the old schedule is better then you'd be rated under it only."

(Some Veterans get confused about this, because Social Security does have this requirement.)\n\n- #### Can My Disability Ratings be Lowered if my Disabilities Improve Due to Medications, other Treatments, or Surgeries?\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE:**\n\n- In **MOST** cases, unless you file a new claim for increase, the VA will **NOT** just come looking at your previously rated conditions!\n\n**CONTINUOUS Medication Usage:**\n\n- If the schedule specifically mentions medication usage - the Veteran will be rated as stated. This generally results in the Veteran getting a higher rating.\n\n- If the schedule does **NOT** mention medication usage - so long as the Veteran continues to take their medication they should **NOT** be reduced!
