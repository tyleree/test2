    "content": "## **Frequently** **Asked Questions**\n\n- #### Can my rating be reduced if taking medication or doing other treatments improve my symptoms?\n\n- **Maybe IF YOU PUT IN a claim for increase**. Yeah, that's the best answer I have gotten from speaking with several senior raters. It will come down to the rater and their judgement. Such as, if they were reduced might it cause the Veteran to return to their original degree of disability etc.\n\n- Generally, if they do decide you should be reduced, it will be by a degree of disability IE 70 to 50%. Instead of 70 to 30%.\n\n- It is recommended if you do ever receive a proposal for reduction that you **quickly** request a [Hearing](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/reduction)\n\n- #### Will my VA doctor snitch on me if I start improving?\n\n- **NO**! There are very specific circumstances in which the VHA and VBA communicate! And improving is **NOT** one of them.\n\n- Click [HERE](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/xtalk)  for details.\n\n- #### Do I have to seek treatment to maintain my rating?\n\n- No.\n\n- #### I experienced a sexual assault/rape while I was AD but I never reported it. Can I still file a claim for PTSD?\n\n- Yes, if you experienced MST during service. You may still file a claim if you never reported it. It is not at all uncommon for service members to suffer in silence. These claims will rely heavily on any evidence you can supply, such as any mental health treatment/therapy sessions, buddy statements from friends and family, etc. Do know, that even if your claim is denied, it does **NOT** mean the rater does not believe you! You might be missing a piece of the claims puzzle. As such, be sure to read your decision letter fully. It will explain what you need to do to win your claim during an [Appeal](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/)\n\n- #### I filed a claim for sleep disturbances/insomnia but my claim lumped with my other mental condition. Why?\n\n- If you have a mental health rating (outside of a eating disorder) then sleep disturbances/insomnia are considered a symptom of your mental health, even if they are caused by a physical issue such as pain. As such, it would be considered pyramiding and is not allowed.\n\n- #### Can I be rated 100% if I currently have a job?\n\n- Maybe... it will be very fact specific. Factors such as; are you full/part time, length of employment, type of employment, and is it in a [Sheltered environment](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/tdiu#sheltered)  etc.\n\n- #### Can I work if I have a 100% for mental health?\n\n- There is no restrictions with working with a 100% mental rating.\n\n- #### If I tell the C&P examiner I am suicidal will I be committed against my will?\n\n- The only time you will be committed against your will is if the examiner has reason to believe you are undergoing a mental health emergency and that you are likely to end your life in the near future. This usually is due to the examiner knowing you have a suicide plan and that you have indicated you have plans to carry them out.\n\n- #### What do I do if the VA has found I cannot handle my money?\n\n- The VA will assign you a fiduciary to handle your money. For more information click [HERE](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/)\n\n- #### Does having a rating for mental health make me ineligible for a security clearance?\n\n- No.\n\n- #### My mental diagnosis changed is that an issue?\n\n- It is not an issue. It is **SUPER** common for those in the mental health profession to have disagreements on what exactly someone's mental health diagnosis is. You cannot really blame them since mental health is **VERY** complicated. If you were service-connected for PTSD and you are now diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) then that's perfectly fine.\n\n- #### My memory is bad... can I bring notes to my exam?\n\n- Yes!\n\n- A word of caution: if you start just reading things off to match with DBQ/rating schedule the examiner might find you to be less believable. Instead, your notes should focus more-so on examples of your issues."

    "content": "## **Categorizes & Severity Explained**\n\nNerve conditions are placed into 1 of 3 categories which are then rated upon their severity.\n\n**RATER NOTES:**\n\n- _Most_ conditions are simply rated as paralysis of the nerve, as it offers the highest evaluations and generally covers most symptoms.\n\n- If a Veteran has a current diagnosis **AND** reports _any_ symptoms, the severity **MUST** at least be mild! Even if the examiner notes there are no symptoms!\n\n- **NEVER** assign an evaluation _higher than_ moderate if symptoms cannot be tested for or seen; It does **NOT** matter if the Veteran reports severe pain!\n\n- Moderate evaluations and above require symptoms which an examiner can test for. Be it decreased sensitivity, reduced reflexes, muscle weakness/atrophy, impairment of function (shaking, slow movements, joints are stiff), and/or loss of hair growth.\n\n- Do know, even if the Veteran _does_ have a testable symptom; It does **NOT** mean that an evaluation of at least moderate is required or appropriate. There can be cases in which a mild evaluation is still the most appropriate decision.\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE:**\n\n- There can be a fair bit of differences of opinions as to how to rate nerve severity. So if you got a mild when you thought you should have gotten at least moderate, filing a [Higher level review](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals#hlr)  _may_ be a good idea."

You may need to take medication, take the day off and isolate, or seek medical attention.

Even if the examiner notes there are no symptoms!\n\n- **NEVER** assign an evaluation _higher than_ moderate if symptoms cannot be tested for or seen; It does **NOT** matter if the Veteran reports severe pain!\n\n- Moderate evaluations and above require symptoms which an examiner can test for. Be it decreased sensitivity, reduced reflexes, muscle weakness/atrophy, impairment of function (shaking, slow movements, joints are stiff), and/or loss of hair growth.\n\n- Do know, even if the Veteran _does_ have a testable symptom; It does **NOT** mean that an evaluation of at least moderate is required or appropriate. There can be cases in which a mild evaluation is still the most appropriate decision.\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE:**\n\n- There can be a fair bit of differences of opinions as to how to rate nerve severity. So if you got a mild when you thought you should have gotten at least moderate, filing a [Higher level review](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals#hlr)  _may_ be a good idea."

I.E. either a rating for sleep apnea **OR** asthma - You **CANNOT** separate ratings for both!\n\n- If the secondary respiratory condition affects the Veteran's overall health _significantly_, then the rating for the dominant respiratory condition can be increased to the next higher rating in the schedule (not just with an added 10%).\n\n- **HOWEVER**, the rater **CANNOT** consider subjective symptoms _or_ symptoms that overlap between the respiratory conditions.\n- Separate ratings for Sinusitis and Rhinitis **ARE ALLOWED**! You just can't get say 2 ratings for different types of sinusitis or rhinitis."

In addition to testing the function of the airways, this test also measures the ability of the lungs to absorb gasses. After inhaling a certain amount of carbon monoxide, the test measures how much is absorbed by the lungs into the blood stream by measuring how much is left in the air that is exhaled.\n\n- Results of this test would be a percentage of how you would compare to a healthy person. 80% and above is considered normal.\n- Exercise test - determines how much oxygen your body uses when functioning at its maximum capacity.\n\n- Results of this test look like: _XX ml/kg/min_.\n- Heart test - if the heart is involved in the respiratory condition a echocardiogram (ECG or EKG), cardiac catheterization, or other tests of the heart may be done.\n\n- Spirometry - determines the functioning of the lungs and the airways leading to the lungs. This test should be done **BEFORE** and **AFTER** you take medication!\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE:**\n\n- In terms of rating - if this test is used to evaluate conditions under diagnostic codes (DC) 6600, 6603, 6604, 6825-6833, and 6840-6845, then the results with the **AFTER** medication results will be used (if medication is used); **UNLESS** the medication made your results worse!\n\nThe following are results that are generated from spirometry tests:\n\n- Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) - the total maximum amount of air that you can exhale after taking a full breath.\n\n- Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV-1) - the maximum amount of air that you can blow out in 1 second.\n\n- Results of this measurement would be a percentage of how you would compare to a healthy person. 70% and above is considered normal.\n- Ratio of FEV-1 to Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) - determined by dividing the FEV-1 by the FVC.\n\n- Results of this measurement would be a percentage of how you would compare to a healthy person. 75% and above is considered normal. However, if the Veteran's FEV-1 or FVC are valued at over 1 (better than what is considered normal) this measure **CANNOT** be used to assign a rating.\n- Flow-Volume Loop - Shows lung capacity and the ability to move air through the airways.\n\n- Results are presented as a graph. From which, an examiner can determine if there is an obstruction that is blocking airflow. Be it an upper airway, extrathoracic, or intrathoracic obstruction."

As such, the Veteran **CANNOT** get single rating for each ear.\n\n- If an ear is **NOT** service connected it is considered to be 100% **PERFECT** working order for rating purposes! (unless special conditions are meet, see special note at bottom of schedule)\n\n- If the examiner does **NOT** test one ear (no results for one ear), the rater is instructed to assume that the untested ear is in 100% **PERFECT** working order!\n\n- In case the examiner forgets to tell you: **REMOVE** your hearing aids **BEFORE** you start the examination!\n\n- Depending on your [MOS](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/loud)  and/or [Combat](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/CombatVet)  experiences, your claim of hearing loss may be given additional weight for consideration for service-connection. Which is _not_ to say, if your MOS is not considered at high risk for noise exposure or that you did not see combat that you cannot get service connection.\n\nIn order to get a proper rating the audiologist conducting the [Examination](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/Cnp)  will conduct two tests to determine your hearing loss.\n\n- Speech discrimination - your ability to understand spoken words. Your examiner will say a word and you repeat it.\n\n- Your responses are then calculated as a percentage (higher percent, meaning better hearing).\n- Puretone audiometry test - your ability to hear tones. You will sit in a box and press a button when you hear a tone.\n\n- The tones the VA cares about are 4000, 3000, 2000, and 1000Hz. The results from those tones (how loud the tone had to be before you heard it) are then added together and divided by 4 to give you your average. The lower the number is, the better your hearing is.\n\n**PRESUMPTIVE CONDITION:**\n\n- Hearing loss is considered a [Presumptive condition](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/time)  if it manifests within _one year_ of separation, **AND** the severity warranted _at least_ a 10% evaluation within that time.\n\nNOTE:\n\n- If you have disabilities that make it impossible/difficult to complete the speech discrimination test you will be rated based on just the puretone test results."

This is undoubtedly the most complicated system devised to rate a condition.\n\nThere are three different ways to rate visual impairment:\n\n1. [Central Visual Acuity](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/eyes#central)\n\n2. [Visual Field](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/eyes#field)\n\n3. [Muscle Dysfunction](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/eyes#muscle)\n\nAnd since we know Veterans can be impaired in more than one measure:\n\n- [Muscle Dysfunction and Central Visual Acuity](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/eyes#mc)\n\n- [Muscle Dysfunction and Visual Field](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/eyes#mv)\n\n- [Muscle Dysfunction, Central Visual Acuity, and Visual Field](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/eyes#all)\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTES:**\n\n- If an eye has a condition that affects muscle dysfunction _and_ central visual acuity or visual field. The Veteran will **NOT** get a separate rating for muscle dysfunction. Instead, the Veteran's visual rating(s) could be increased.\n\n- If only one eye is affected and the other eye is _VA_ normal (at least 20/40 corrected vision), then the combined rating of both visual acuity and visual field (including any increase from muscle function) the visual impairment rating for the eye **CANNOT** be higher than 30%! This does **NOT** include other possible eye condition ratings.\n\n- If only one eye is service-connected for visual impairment. The other eye for rating purposes is considered to be at 20/40.\n\n- **UNLESS**, the service-connected **AND** non-service-connected eye has a visual acuity of 20/200 or less; **OR** the peripheral field of vision for each eye is 20 degrees or less. Then the non-service connected eye **WILL** be considered service-connected for rating purposes."

It runs on the familiar 20/20 scale. So the worse the vision is, the smaller the number. e.g. 20/100 (0.2) is worse than 20/50 (0.4).\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTES:**\n\n- Your rating is based upon **CORRECTED DISTANCE VISION**. So if your distance vision is more or less good in _both_ eyes with glasses... well enjoy your low rating.\n\n- Again, for the purposes of the VA, normal vision is 20/40. If you only have one eye examined and not the other. The rater is instructed to assume that eye is normal. Barring of course a note stating the Veteran is missing said eye."

Resulting most commonly in double vision (diplopia)\n\nBelow is an example of a chart (colorized) used to determine muscle dysfunction:\n\nSimilar to the one used in the field of vision test. However, the key parts are the 4 quadrants (up, temporally, down, and nasally) and the semi circles within them.\n\nThe colors correspond to values in the below table:\n\n| Color | Assigned Visual Acuity |\n| --- | --- |\n| Green | 20/40 |\n| Blue | 20/70 |\n| Purple | 20/100 |\n| Yellow | 20/200 |\n| Orange | 15/200 |\n| Red | 5/200 |\n\n- For an example of how a rating for muscle dysfunction is figured out from the chart click [HERE](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/muscleex)"

    "content": "### Example: Calculating Estimated Skin Surface Area and Percentages of Total Body\n\n1\\. Identify which area(s) of skin are affected.\n\n- In the above example:\n\n- Front of Torso and Genitalia are affected.\n\n2\\. Shape off sections of affected skin, so you can measure the area. If the area has does not allow for a single square/rectangle/triangle. Then you will need to make several shapes to get a more accurate estimate.\n\n3\\. Find the area of your shapes. Time to take off your socks and do some math! Measure the area(s) of the affected skin.\n\n- In our pictured example:\n\n- Front of Torso is 7\"x8\" so area is 56 in².\n\n- Genitalia is 5\"x5\" so area is 25 in².\n\n**Math Reminders**\n\n- Square and rectangles: width times length.\n\n- Right angle triangle: width times length then divide the area by 2.\n\n- So if the length and width are 2\" and 5\" multiply to get an area of 10 in² _then_ divide the area by 2 to get a final area of 5 in².\n\n4\\. Add your areas per body section If your skin condition is made up of multiple shapes, add those areas together per [Body section](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/skin#estimate)\n\n- In our pictured example:\n\nWe did not have multiple areas of the same body sections affected. So no work for us to do here.\n\n- Total Front of Torso: 56 in².\n\n- Total Genitalia: 25 in².\n\n5\\. Calculate total area of _exposed skin_ Remember, the body sections considered exposed are:\n\n- Front of Head;\n\n- Back of Head;\n\n- Front of Neck;\n\n- Back of Neck;\n\n- Back of Hand/Fingers; and\n\n- Palm of Hand/Fingers.\n\n**Add** up the areas of all exposed body sections then **divide** by **368in** ². Now multiply that answer by **100** to get a percentage of exposed skin that is affected.\n\nIf your combined exposed area was 120 in². We would do 120/368 to get 0.3260. Then multiply 0.3260 by 100 to get 32.60%.\n\nGiving us a total area of exposed skin of 32.6%.\n\n- However, in our pictured example: We did not have any areas of exposed skin.\n\n6\\. Calculate total area of affected skin\n\n**Add** up all the areas of all body sections then **divide** by **2636in** ². Now multiply that answer by **100** to get a percentage of total skin that is affected.\n\n- In our pictured example:\n\n- Total Front of Torso: 56 in² + Total Genitalia: 25 in² = 81 in²\n\n- 81 in² /2636 in² = 0.0307 times 100 = 3.07%\n\n- Percentage of Total Body affected is 3.07%\n\nWith the percentages of total body and possibly exposed skin. You can now use the [General rating formula](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/skin#general)  to determine your rating."

    "content": "## **Frequently** **Asked Questions**\n\n- #### How long will it take for my claim to finish?\n\n- Claim completion time varies from a few weeks to over a year. This depends on several factors:\n\n- The type of claim you filed.\n\n- How many injuries or disabilities you claimed and how complex they are.\n\n- How long it takes the VA to collect the evidence needed to decide your claim.\n\n- The availability of examiners in your area for the type of examination(s) you require.\n- To see what the current average time it takes to complete a claim click [HERE](https://www.benefits.va.gov/reports/mmwr_va_claims_online.asp)\n\n- #### How do I check the status of my claim?\n\n- You can check the status of your claim [HERE](https://www.va.gov/claim-or-appeal-status/)  However, we do **NOT** recommend you constantly check as your claim can and **WILL** go back and forth in the steps\n\n- You can also check your status via the [VA Claim Tracking App](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/va-claim-tracker/onbanekcefgnibhlaiimeadkbdahjpoo)\n\n- #### Can the VA work my claim during the weekend/holidays?\n\n- Yes.\n\n- #### What do I do while I wait?!\n\n- Try and take up a hobby to fill up your time and head instead of constantly checking and worrying about your claim.\n\n- #### I have evidence to submit in support of my claim but I don't want to mail/fax evidence!\n\n- Not a question.... But you **CAN** submit evidence via the [Quick submit portal](https://eauth.va.gov/accessva/?cspSelectFor=quicksubmit)  online.\n\n- #### The VA website/App is down!?\n\n- It is not uncommon for the VA to do maintenance on the weekends.\n\n- #### Can I use a lawyer or claims agent to help me file a new claim?\n\n- Yes, accredited attorneys and claims agents can help you. However, since they **CANNOT** charge you a percentage of your back pay for new claims, they typically only become involved on appeals (after a claim has been denied).\n\n- #### What should I do if I disagree with my claim's decision?\n\n- If you disagree with your claim's decision (all or parts) you can [Appeal](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals)  the decision. You have up to one year to appeal the decision and still preserve the initial \"intent to file\" [Effective date](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/edate)  of the claim.\n\n- #### Can I file for a secondary condition if the primary condition is not yet service-connected?\n\n- Yes, so long as the primary condition is either filed within the same claim, is currently undecided in another claim, _or_ is currently undecided in an appeal.\n\n- #### The CD I got from medical is password protected, I don't remember the password?\n\n- Try the last four of your social security number and the first three letters of your first name in lowercase.\n\n- #### If I file an new claim/increase, can the VA reduce my ratings?\n\n- Yes, by filing a claim you invite the VA to review your file. If it is found that a [Clear and Unmistakable Error](https://www.reddit.com/r/VeteransBenefits/wiki/appeals/#wiki_clear_and_unmistakable_error_.28cue.29)  occurred and you were rated either too high or that service-connection was granted in error, the VA WILL start action to fix the error! Further, if exams show your condition(s) have improved, the VA _can_ start action to reduce you!\n\n- Do know that the rater will stick to the path for the most part. Meaning, if you file for say your right knee, they are not gonna be poking around unrelated ratings like your mental health or shoulder.\n\n- #### If I file a claim secondary to something, will the VA automatically reevaluate the primary condition?\n\n- Not always. If you do not indicate in your claim or in any statements that the primary condition has worsened the VA **SHOULD** _not_ evaluate the primary condition. However, in practice this is not always followed.\n\n- #### Do I need to resubmit evidence that I provided for a previous claim/appeal?\n\n- No, evidence provided to the VA stays in your permanent file and can be freely accessed for use in new claims.\n\n- #### If I was seen by a civilian doctor in-service are those records considered Service Treatment Records?\n\n- Yes. Do know that TriCare may not have received all of those medical records so you should either supply those records to the VA or sign the [Release](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/vba-21-4142-are.pdf)  to allow the VA to obtain them for you.\n\n- #### If an injury occurred while I was on leave can I get service-connection?\n\n- So long as the injury was not the result of gross-misconduct, certainly!\n\n- #### I just got granted/denied an increase claim, is there a set time I must wait before filing another increase claim?\n\n- No, you can file right away.\n\n- #### Can I file multiple claims/appeals at once?\n\n- Yes, you can file multiple claims/separate appeals at the same time.\n\nNOTES:\n\n- If you file additional claims while a previous claim is still being processed the new claim **WILL BE** closed administratively and merged with the prior claim. This merging does **NOT** allow those later conditions to be considered received with the older claim - merely that they are processed together.\n\n- You **CANNOT** file multiple appeals for the **_SAME_** _issue_ at the **SAME** time.\n\n- #### If I have a claim and appeal(s) open at the same time can the VA rate them together?\n\n- Generally speaking, the rater can rate them at the same time - assuming both are ready to be rated at the same time and that there is no [Jurisdictional](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/jurisdiction)  conflict.\n\n- #### Will filing a new claim slow down any active appeals I have?\n\n- No, each appeal is processed separately from all other claims/appeals.\n\n- #### Will filing additional claims slow my current claim down?\n\n- Maybe:\n\n- If you are in line to get before a rater it will kick it out of line and back to [Step 2](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/stages)\n\n- If you were in steps 3 or 4 then no real loss in terms of speed.\n\n- #### My claim closed for NO REASON!?",

Just like [Filing a claim](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vaclaim)  you _may_ use the assistance of a [VSO](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vso)  lawyer, or an accredited claims agent.\n\nThere are three initial different methods to appeal:\n\n1. Higher-Level Review;\n\n2. Supplemental claim; or\n\n3. Board of Veteran Appeals (BVA).\n\nIf your appeal is denied again you **CAN** try another eligible option (see applicable notes).\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTES:**\n\n- If you want to keep your [Effective date](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/edate)  (your back pay) you **MUST** file an appeal within **one year** of your claim's decision date! Veterans who fail to do that can only get their original effective date and back pay if there is a [Clear and Unmistakable Error (CUE)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals#cue)\n\n- Lawyers and claims agents **CANNOT** charge more than **33.3%**\\\\* (excluding expenses\\*\\*) of the Veteran's back pay. Further, they can _only_ get paid if/when the Veteran wins their appeal. Again, VSOs are a resource that is free to the Veteran.\n\n- **PICK A LANE**! You **CANNOT** file multiple appeals/methods for the _same issue_ at the same time ( _without_ first withdrawing the current appeal)!\n\n- If you filed an appeal to BVA and are tired of waiting you **CANNOT** then file a supplemental claim while the BVA case is pending for the _same issues_.\n\n- Likewise, you **CANNOT** file an HLR and supplemental claim for the same issue at the same time, etc.\n\n- You **CAN** file an HLR for [Hearing loss](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/ears)  and a supplemental claim for a [Back](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/spine)  issue at the same time - since they are _different issues_.\n\n- **EXCEPTION:**\n\n- If you have an appeal in at a court above BVA you **_CAN_** then have a separate appeal open for the same issue (just can't go immediately back to the previous lower court).\n\n\\*The VA will only pay up to 20% automatically from the back pay. If the agreement is over 20% then, the Veteran will need to pay the difference to the lawyer themselves.\n\n\\*\\*Expenses can be things like postage, travel costs, or printing supplies."

Even if you have new evidence showing a higher evaluation was previously warranted! If you do, at best the effective date will be the date the supplemental was initiated or at **WORST** the date of the examination conducted **AFTER** your filed the supplemental! So in these cases, just file a increase claim!\n\nNOTES:\n\n- Veterans **CAN** file a supplemental claim **ANYTIME** after their denial. However, to _potentially_ get back pay from the start, they _must_ file within a year of the last decision.\n\n- Veterans **CAN** submit a supplemental claim over and over again. _So long as_, there is new and relevant evidence being submitted _every time_.\n\n- If you need the VA to get non-federal medical records or [Vet Center](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vetcenter)  records for you, then you will need to also submit a [VA Form 21-4142/21-4142a](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/vba-21-4142-are.pdf)\n\n| Question | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Should I choose this? | If your appeal requires new evidence. |\n| What will happen? | A decision will be made looking at the new and previous evidence. |"

This can be done by:\n\n- Submitting a [Personal statement](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/personal)  saying you want to remove/revoke access to your specific representative;\n\n- Calling the VA at 1-800-698-2411 and let them know \"Please remove \\[Name of representative\\] as my representative immediately.\"; _or_\n\n- Assigning someone new as your representative be it another attorney, claim agent, or [VSO](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vso)\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE:**\n\n- Removing their representation does **NOT VOID** the fee agreement (you likely signed)! If it did there would be a lot of slick Veterans trying to screw over their representative.\n\n- Again, if you later win your appeal and you feel they did not earn their fee you **CAN** still fight it (as mentioned previously)."

    "content": "## **Clear and Unmistakable Error (CUE)**\n\nOh no, it has been over a year but I still want all my back pay! If your claim has a CUE it is possible to still get that back pay.\n\nCUEs are **EXTREMELY** fact specific as such it is **STRONGLY** advised that the Veteran seek out an experienced VSO or lawyer to help them! If the Veteran makes an error in their filing the VA does **NOT** have a duty to assist them in the cases of CUEs. As such the CUE may be wasted.\n\nCUEs are **NOT** a matter of a difference in opinion. CUEs involve errors that **CANNOT** be debated and must be such, that a _reasonable person_ would agree that the VA messed up.\n\nCUEs must be based upon evidence that was available to the VA at the time the decision was made. The Veteran **CANNOT** assert that later evidence or evidence that was not given to the VA proved that the Veteran should have been given a favorable decision!\n\nFurther, CUEs **MUST** be considered in the realm of what the laws/regulations/policies were _at the time they were decided_. Veterans **CANNOT** try to apply current laws/regulations/policies to decisions that were made prior to them!\n\nIn order to invoke a CUE the Veteran **MUST** state a CUE has occurred _AND_ **MUST** specify the factual or legal error(s) at issue.\n\n**Seriously, get help!**\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTES:**\n\n- You only get **_ONE_** shot at a CUE per issue. That's it! If you pick something that isn't a CUE and you look back and 'gosh, oh shoot this other thing is the CUE!' That is it. Thanks for playing!\n\n- [Duty to Assist](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/dta)  errors can **NEVER** be the basis of a CUE; as only evidence of record at the time of the prior decision can be considered.\n\n- CUEs are a knife that **CAN** cut both ways! Meaning these errors getting corrected **CAN** end up hurting or helping you. It is common for raters to find multiple additional CUEs when you declare a CUE; since a rater who already made at least 1 CUE is generally just gonna mess everything else up!\n\n- CUEs **CANNOT** sever service-connection for conditions that have been service-connected for at least 10 years (barring findings of the grant itself having no legal basis or fraud).\n\n- If [Secondary](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/claimtype#secondary)  service-connection is granted for a condition **AND** the condition it is secondary to is severed, then the VA will then propose to sever the secondary conditions - assuming there are no other routes to grant them service-connection.\n- CUEs **CANNOT** reduce an evaluation held for at least 20 years.\n- Forgotten claims (conditions not rated) and missed issues (conditions that should have been inferred or ancillary benefits that were overlooked) are **NOT** CUEs! While they are certainly administrative errors, they are _not_ CUEs because the VA has not erred in making a decision one way or the other.\n\n- Generally forgotten and missed issues/benefits **CAN** be granted **WITH** back dated effective dates! You just need to point out in the claim/appeal that the VA failed to rate the issues in the previous decision and **EXPLAIN** why the VA should have considered it or that you meet the criteria of a grant previously and the VA failed to grant.\n\n- Commonly missed ancillary benefits are things like [Special Monthly Compensation (SMC)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/smc)  and [Chapter 35](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/survivorbenefits#dea)\n\n- Commonly missed inferred conditions are things like [Residual scars](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/skin#7802)  and secondary [Nerve issues](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/nerveindex)  due to a [Spine](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/spine)  condition.\n\n- NOTE: Inferring issues became policy circa 2014. So missed inferred issues prior to this year **CANNOT** be considered.\n- The VA does not have a form for forgotten claims or CUES; So you can file via a [Personal statement](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/personal)  or on a [(20-0995)](http://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-20-0995-ARE.pdf)  to help the VA with keeping track of the claim."

    "content": "## **Frequently** **Asked Questions**\n\n- #### How do I check the status of my appeal?\n\n- You can check the status of your appeals on [VA.gov](http://va.gov/)  by calling 1 (800) 827-1000, or making a [VERA appointment](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vera)\n\n- #### I filed my HLR/Supplemental claim via QuickSubmit and it has not shown up online yet?\n\n- It can take a week or two before it will show up online.\n\n- #### My appeal shows closed but my conditions are still unchanged. Have I been denied?\n\n- It is possible, however the VA websites often do not update everything at the same time. So give it another day.\n\n- Alternatively, if you filed an HLR. If an error was found that required the VA to obtain new evidence then your HLR will be administratively closed and re-opened as a supplemental claim.\n\n- #### You mentioned other power/authority DROs have?\n\n- In addition to the ability to issue differences of opinions: DROs are allowed to declare CUEs (that do not harm the vet) without getting another person to approve their determination.\n\n- #### During my HLR the VA found a duty to assist error and are sending me to another C&P exam. Can I now submit additional evidence, if I have some?\n\n- Yes, your appeal has now become a supplemental claim. So you are free to [Submit](https://eauth.va.gov/accessva/?cspSelectFor=quicksubmit)  any new and relevant evidence to your claim.\n\n- #### How do I change review options at the Board?\n\n- Fill out a new Board Appeal form. Make sure you check the box for the new review option, and list all of the issues.\n\n- **IMPORTANT:** You have **one year** from the date on the decision, or **60 days** from the date that you submitted your Board Appeal, whichever is later to make this change!\n\n- #### How do I request different Board review options for different issues?\n\n- You can submit one Board Appeal form and attach additional pages to explain how you want your issues reviewed, or you can submit multiple Board Appeal forms \"“ one for each review option.\n\n- #### I lost my BVA appeal, what can I do now?\n\n- If you disagree with the Board's decision and have new and relevant evidence that supports your case, you can file a Supplemental Claim. You can also appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims.\n\n- #### How do I change my appeal from a Board Appeal to Supplemental Claim or Higher-Level Review?\n\n- Tell the Board in writing that you wish to withdraw your Board Appeal. Then you can file a Supplemental Claim or Higher-Level Review.\n\n- #### Should I hire an attorney/claims agent?\n\n- That is a personal decision. However, unless your appeal hangs on a certain legal issue/angle then the benefit they provide may not be there.\n\n- #### Can I file an appeal a specific condition decision, or do I have to appeal the entire claim?\n\n- You can appeal a single decision, two, all of them, etc. Do know you **CANNOT** appeal the same condition via multiple appeal types at the same time!\n\n- #### On the supplemental claim form, what does \"Check this box if any issue listed below is being withdrawn from the legacy appeals process. OPT-IN from SOC/SSOC\"?\n\n- This box only applies to Veterans who are wanting to convert their 'legacy appeal' to the modern appeal processes. In short, unless you have been in a continuous appeal since circa 2017, this box does **NOT** apply to you and **CAN** be ignored.\n\n- #### If I file an appeal, can the VA reduce my ratings?\n\n- Yes, by filing an appeal you invite the VA to review your file. If it is found that a Clear and Unmistakable Error occurred and you were rated either too high or that service-connection was granted in error, the VA **WILL** start action to fix the error! That said, a mere difference of opinion is **NOT** enough! Further, if exams are ordered as apart of you claim and it is found that your condition(s) have improved, the VA _can_ start action to reduce you!\n\n- #### Will I need to resubmit evidence that I previously submitted?\n\n- No, the VA permanently keeps **ALL** records they receive.\n\n- #### Will my pay be paused while the VA works on my appeal?\n\n- Your pay will continue as appropriate, during the appeals process.\n\n- #### Can I file multiple appeals on a single supplemental or HLR form?\n\n- Yes.\n\n- #### Will filing an appeal slow down any active claims/appeals I have?\n\n- No, each appeal is processed separately from all other claims/appeals.\n\n- In the event a separate appeal/claim hinges on the out outcome of its sister, then just the entangled issue(s) will be held in a waiting pattern till the primary issue is decided.\n\n- #### Can I use a BVA case as evidence to support my own appeal?\n\n- No, BVA cases do **NOT** establish precedence, only CAVC courts and higher do. However, you can try and use arguments presented in those cases.\n\n- #### If I file a supplemental claim will I get new exam(s)?\n\n- It is typical to get new exams or [Medical opinions](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/imo)  when you file a supplemental. However, if your appeal does not properly address the rationale for the denial it may be found not appropriate to order you exams/opinions.\n\n- #### My attorney/claim agent told me NOT TO TALK to the VA and that all communication needs to go through them?\n\n- This is generally **VERY BAD** advice and serves more to drag out the length of an appeal (more money for them) than it would help you.\n\n- Further the VA will **NOT** honor a request for \"exclusive contact\" wherein the VA is prohibited from contacting the Veteran. You can of course refuse to respond/speak with the VA, as is your right - but you may find it best to answer questions as appropriate, especially if they are for the purposes of clarification."

Burial benefits are made up of the burial allowance itself, Plot benefits, and Transportation benefit.\n\nNot every Veteran's survivors are entitled to a Burial allowance. If your Veteran was not in receipt of benefits at death, did not have a pending claim at death, or did not pass away under care, the claim for Burial benefits will very likely be denied.\n\n- **NSC Death**: This is VA's version of the [Social Security $255 Lump Sum Death Benefit](https://www.ssa.gov/forms/ssa-8.html)  The Veteran had to have been in receipt of benefits at the time of death ( [Compensation](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vaclaim)  or [Pension](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/pension)\n\n- The current _Maximum_ Burial Allowance is $978 and $978 for a plot.\n- **SC Death**: This is VA's burial decision indicating that the Veteran's death was somehow tied to their military service. The biggest driver of this is the combination of issues that the Veteran was rated for during their lifetime and the published cause of death on the death certificate. If you select SC Burial as an option on the application and that link is **NOT** obvious, you will get a letter asking you to provide scientific or medical evidence.\n\n- The _Maximum_ Burial allowance is $2,000.\n\n- Alternatively, if the Veteran is buried in a VA national cemetery - the whole costs of moving the remains _may_ be covered.\n- **Death Under Care**: Those not in receipt can only be awarded Burial benefits if they died under care. Dying under care is an unofficial catch-all to describe death that happens at or in transit to/from a Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC), death at a State Veterans Home, or death at a contract nursing home. The nursing home that a Veteran deceased at would have been arranged by the local VAMC to qualify as death under care.\n\n- The current _Maximum_ Burial Allowance is $978 and $978 for a plot."

The annuity is based on a percentage of retired pay and **IS** an inflation-adjusted!\n\nPremiums for SBP coverage are taken from pre-tax retiree pay; which saves you money (vs. paying from post-tax). The average premium are well below the cost for a conventional insurance policy so for most retirees, SBP is a good choice.\n\nThe maximum SBP annuity payment for a spouse is 55% of the member's retired pay (or in the case of a member who retires under REDUX, the retired pay the member would have received if under the high-three retirement system). However, a smaller amount may be elected.\n\nEligible children may also be SBP beneficiaries, either alone or added to spouse coverage. In the latter case, the children receive benefits only if the spouse dies or otherwise becomes ineligible to receive the annuity. Eligible children equally divide a benefit that is 55% of the member's elected base amount. Child coverage is relatively inexpensive because children get benefits only while they are considered eligible dependents.\n\nCoverage is also available for a former spouse or, if the retiree has no spouse or children, for an \"insurable interest\" (such as a business partner or parent).\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE:**\n\n- Surviving spouses maintain their eligibility until death, as long as they do **NOT** remarry before the age of 55. If the spouse remarries before age 55, payments will stop!\n\n- However, if the marriage later ends for _any_ reason, their eligibility for the annuity is returned and just needs to be [Managed](https://www.dfas.mil/RetiredMilitary/survivors/manage/)"

Asking the VA to decide your claim fulfills the 5103 notice requirement. In effect saving you from having to wait a month, whenever someone at the VA realizes no one ever sent the notice out.\n\nSo yes, for those who say it does nothing... You are right in the _vast majority_ of cases."

Failure to do so **WILL** result in your claim being removed from the BDD program! Specifically, the VA is requires your _Separation Health Assessment - Part A Self-Assessment (SHA, Part A)_.\n\n- Private medical records (treatment outside a military provider) is generally **NOT** included into your STRs unless **YOU** have them added. Ask your base medical how they want to go about this. They should accept copies of those records or have a fax number the providers can send your records to.\n\n- You can obtain your STRs [HERE](https://patientportal.mhsgenesis.health.mil/)\n\n- You can upload evidence via this [LINK](https://eauth.va.gov/accessva/?cspSelectFor=quicksubmit)\n- If some records are missing/incomplete that is fine - just submit what you can for now!\n- You do **NOT** need to attend all your exams before the window closes or even before you separate.\n\n- **ALWAYS** keep the VA updated of your location! That way they can properly notify you any [Examinations](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/#cnp)\n\n- BDD claims **CANNOT** have ratings finalized till the day **AFTER** you officially separate from active duty!\n\n- If you had a previous period of service and had claimed condition(s) denied, you **MUST** file an appropriate [Appeal](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals)  to re-claim those denied issues!\n\n- If you decide to file for additional conditions when you are _under 90 days_ to separation, a separate claim **WILL** be created while the BDD continues as a BDD claim!\n\n- Intents to file mean **NOTHING** for a BDD claim as the effective date of any grants **CANNOT** be earlier than the day **AFTER** you separate from the military.\n\n**RATER NOTES:**\n\n- Seriously, if you have **NOT** been seen in-service for your claimed condition(s) it is **CRITICAL**that you file **_BEFORE_** you separate! It **WILL GREATLY** help you in getting [Service-connection](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/serviceconnection)  So even if it might delay you getting a decision it **WILL GREATLY** help you in the end!\n\n- Seriously, the bar to get service-connection gets **NO LOWER** than when you file a claim while **STILL ON ACTIVE DUTY**! In short, in **MOST** cases so long as you can get a _current diagnosis_ you will get service-connection!\n\nNOTES:\n\n- BDD claims _are_ given [Priority](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/fast)  in terms of claims processing.\n\n- All conditions will be considered under [Primary service-connection](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/serviceconnection)  even if they are factually due to another condition.\n\n- Unless there is clear and unmistakable evidence the condition was preexisting, then the VA will consider under [Aggravation](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/agg)"

    "content": "## **Frequently** **Asked Questions**\n\n- #### When is the VA going to order my exams!?\n\n- Really hard to say, depending on local conditions (how backed up examiners are), it can take beyond your separation date. But ideally, you should have your exams sorted out within two months of filing.\n\n- #### How long will it be before my claim is rated?\n\n- The million dollar question! Ideally, the VA would have your rating ready to go, the day after you separate. However, it rarely happens that way. Realistically, you should get a decision in one-three months after separation.\n\n- #### Who gave the VA a time machine! My claim status shows a date in the future?\n\n- The date shown is the date after you separate from the military. This is because your [Effective date](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/edate)  cannot be any earlier.\n\n- #### Do I have to explain how I developed a condition?\n\n- No, when you joined the military you did so with a presumption of soundness - meaning you were 100% healthy (barring anything brought up at MEPS). So the fact something popped up while you were in service means you are good to go (unless it is something the VA will [NOT service connect](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/NoRate)\n\n- #### My separation date changed! Do I need to do anything?\n\n- Call the VA (1-800-827-1000) and let them know whats is going on, as a courtesy.\n\n- #### Whoops, looks like I am just gonna stay in the military. Do I need to do anything?\n\n- Yes! Submit a [Personal statement](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/personal)  explaining the situation. Failure to do so _may_ result in a debt being created - if the VA starts paying you!\n\n- #### The website is not letting me submit a claim online! I get a message to contact the VA and the phone people are not able to help me!\n\n- Looks like you ran into a technical issue (welcome to the VA!). If the VA is unable to sort this issue out and your BDD window is closing fast you should submit your claim via a [VSO](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com//vso)  or via fax: 844-531-7818.\n\n- #### I am in the National Guard/Reserves can I file a BDD claim?\n\n- Yes, if you are on Active Duty or Title 32 orders (and you are in the BDD window) - you **CAN** file a BDD claim.\n\n- #### Oh no! VA sent me a letter saying they were removeing me from the BDD program!\n\n- Your claim will continue but without the benefit of BDD priority.\n\n- #### I am almost separated but no exams! What is wrong!?\n\n- Some locations are more backed up than others. So sometimes you may not be able to get all your exams done till after you separate. This will **NOT** remove you from the BDD program!\n\n- #### Should I submitted personal and buddy statements?\n\n- You really do not need to. If you really wanted to, it would generally be helpful with respect to talking about the severity of a condition.\n\n- The following links has information on statements:\n\n- [Personal Statements](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/personal)\n\n- [Buddy Statements](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/buddy)\n\n- #### I forgot to claim something. Can't I just talk to my examiner about it and the VA can grant?\n\n- Certainly talk to your examiner about **ALL** your issues! But know the VA _generally_ **CANNOT** grant things without you formally claiming them!\n\n- In most cases it will be best to formally file claims for those additional conditions (sooner than later).\n\n- #### The rating schedule changed between the time I filed my BDD claim and separation; what rating schedule will I be rated under?\n\n- You will be rated under the rating schedule in effective the day **AFTER** you separate.\n\n- If the rating schedule changed while you were on Active Duty then you **WILL** be rated under the new schedule.\n\n- If the rating schedule changed _2 days or more_ **AFTER** you separate, then you'd be considered under _both_ schedules (assuming a decision wasn't made exactly on the day after you separated):\n\n- If the new schedule is better you'd be rated under the old schedule till the new schedule became effective.\n\n- If the old schedule is better then you'd be rated under it only."

To misrepresent the severity of your condition is a **CRIME**!\n\n- **DO** **NOT** treat the schedule as a check list of things to say _or_ do!\n\n- Please use the schedule more as a means to understand what the VA is looking for.

This is because **CONTINUOUS** improvement **MUST** be shown when the evaluation has been held for at least 5 _continuous_ years.\n\nIn **MOST** cases it will take another exam showing the condition is still improved before the Veteran **WILL** receive a [Proposal for reduction](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/reduction)  (if the reduction reduces your [Combined](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vamath)  evaluation; otherwise the condition will be reduced without notice).\n\nPractical example to be reduced based on **ONE EXAM**:\n\n- The condition is rated on lab results like [Kidney](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gensystem)  or [Lung function](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/airsystem)  and the VA _happens_ to have lab results that show improvement\"¦ whelp if _you filed an increase_ for that condition for some reason - you should **EXPECT** a reduction/proposal based if the VA does another lab test because of your claim and it confirms the improvement!\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTES:**\n\n- This protection does **NOT** reset after 5 years!

No matter how many days are actually in the month. So if that course started on February 21, you would be paid 9/30 the normal MHA amount for the month of February.\n\n  - For more examples click [HERE](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/money#education).\n- People who have courses that start/stop on different dates may have their amount of MHA reduced, if they fall below full time status.\n\n- Round-Out Rule: If during your last semester, your remaining credits to graduate is _less than_ what you need to be considered full time. You **CAN** take non-required courses to fill up your schedule to achieve full time _without_ penalty.\n\n  - If you do **NOT** fill up on courses then your MHA will be **REDUCED** appropriately!\n\n* * *",

If you are an officer, you must have agreed to serve 6 years in addition to your original obligation. For some types of training it is necessary to have a 6-year commitment that begins after September 30, 1990.\n\n- Complete your initial Active Duty for Training (IADT). Meet the requirement to receive a high school diploma or equivalency certificate before completing IADT. You may not use 12 hours toward a college degree to meet this requirement.\n\n- Remain in good standing while serving in an active Selected Reserve unit. You will also retain MGIB-SR eligibility if you were discharged from Selected Reserve service due to a disability that was not caused by misconduct. Your eligibility period may be extended if you are ordered to active duty.\n\nYour eligibility for this program normally ends the day you leave the Selected Reserve.\n\nAn exception exists if you are mobilized or recalled to Active Duty from your reserve status in which case your eligibility may be extended for the amount of time you are mobilized PLUS 4 months. For example, if you are mobilized for 12 months, your eligibility period is extended for 16 months; 12 months of Active Duty PLUS 4 months. Even if you leave the Reserves after mobilization, you may have additional eligibility under the MGIB-SR.\n\nIf your unit was deactivated during the period beginning October 1, 2007, through September 30, 2014, or you were involuntarily separated for reasons other than misconduct, you will retain your original period of eligibility, which is 14 years from the date of your first 6-year obligation with the Selected Reserves.\n\n[Return to top](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#top)",

Even if the VA does cover everything you **CAN** generally pocket that money after everything filters through your school!\n\n  - How this works is: School counts up what all fees and tuition you owe and offsets that by any loans, scholarships, grants, etc. If there ends up being a positive balance in your account when everything is said and done you will be refunded that positive balance! If the school applies your loans, scholarships, etc before VA pays the school **THAT IS FINE**! As in the end, the VA will pay the school as appropriate meaning any left over positive balance is still **YOURS**!\n\n    - Tuition assistance through say a job will not result in you pocketing that money. You will in essence be giving the government a discount is all.\n\n    - Scholarships and grants can be pocketed! So be sure to file for them!\n\n- #### If I switch to the Post 9/11 GI Bill can I get my $1,200 back?\n\n- Yes, if you exhaust all 36 months you will get the money back in your final MHA payment. If you are **NOT** receiving MHA in your final month then you will **NOT** get this money back automatically!\n\n- #### Will I have to repay the VA if I fail a course?\n\n- No, so long as the Veteran did not fail due to failure to attend the course (the professor annotated that the Veteran failed purely due to non-attendance). This is not to be confused with failure due to poor performance that may have been due to non/poor attendance.\n\n- #### Will I have to repay the VA if I drop (withdraw) a course?\n\n- Maybe, if the course(s) you drop do not put you below full time you will not create any debt.\n\nIf the course(s) you drop put you below full time you **may** create a debt."

When Congress was contemplating giving online programs housing allowance, schools were propping up shell campuses at high allowance locations to lure Vets to their online programs. So to help prevent this issue, it was decided that half the national rate would be best.\n\n- #### When do I get paid my housing allowance!?\n\n- Two things:\n\n1. VA pays in arrears meaning: You are paid at the end of the of the month for the same month. So - September is paid at the **END** of September, etc.\n\n2. Benefits are paid out by the Treasury Department using a **_10 business day window_** centered around the end of the month. Meaning - there is no specific date each month the Treasury is required to pay any VA education benefits.\n\n- #### I know VA disability does not pro-rate disability payments. But can my housing allowance get pro-rated?\n\n- **YES**! Unlike VA disability, education benefits **ARE** prorated (getting paid for partial months).\n\n- #### I qualify for both the Montgomery and the Post 9/11, which is best?"

    "content": "## **Frequently** **Asked Questions**\n\n- #### What does CHAMPVA pay?\n\n- In most cases, CHAMPVA's allowable amount (what VA pays) for specific services and supplies—is equivalent to Medicare/TRICARE rates. CHAMPVA has an outpatient deductible ($50 per beneficiary per calendar year or a maximum of $100 per family per calendar year) and a patient cost share of 25% of our allowable amount up to the catastrophic cap ($3,000 per calendar year). Beneficiaries should NOT send checks to VHA OCC for their annual deductible; as claims are processed, charges are automatically credited to individual and family deductible requirements for each calendar year.\n\n- If your provider accepts assignment, which means the provider accepts CHAMPVA, the provider agrees to accept the VA's allowable amount as payment in full. A provider cannot bill you for the difference between the VA's allowable amount and their normally billed amount.\n\n- If the patient has other health insurance, then CHAMPVA pays the lesser of either 75% of the allowable amount after the $50 calendar year deductible is satisfied, or the remainder of the charges and the beneficiary will normally have no cost share.\n\n- #### How long will it take for me to get a response after applying?\n\n4-6 months.\n\n- #### I need coverage NOW but it is taking forever to get approved for CHAMPVA! What can I do?\n\nPay out of pocket for now and to file for reimbursement once you are finally approved.\n\n- #### Can the Veteran get coverage under CHAMPVA?\n\nOnly if they are eligible via their spouse or being a caregiver as noted previously.\n\n- #### Are health care services at VA facilities available to CHAMPVA beneficiaries?\n\n- Only at participating VA facilities (most VA facilities do **NOT** participate).\n\n- Under the CHAMPVA In-house Treatment Initiative (CITI), CHAMPVA beneficiaries may receive cost-free health care services at _participating_ VA facilities.",

CHAMPVA beneficiaries don’t pay out-of-pocket expenses when receiving services under the CITI program.\n\n- #### Can a dependent parent parent be covered under CHAMPVA?\n\n- No. According to [38 CFR § 17.271 - Eligibility](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/38/17.271) they are **NOT** eligible (outside of being an appropriate caregiver)\n\n- #### Can CHAMPVA act as primary insurance if I have another insurance?\n\n- **NO _UNLESS_** the other insurance is:\n\n  - Medicaid;\n\n  - State Victims of Crime Compensation Programs;\n\n  - Indian Health Services; or\n\n  - Supplemental CHAMPVA policies.\n\n- #### Can CHAMPVA be secondary (supplemental insurance) if I have another insurance?\n\n- **YES _UNLESS_** the other insurance is:\n\n  - Medicaid;\n\n  - State Victims of Crime Compensation Programs;\n\n  - Indian Health Services; or\n\n  - Supplemental CHAMPVA policies.\n\n- #### If CHAMPVA is secondary how does the billing work?\n\n- Your health care provider should bill the other insurance first. The provider should then submit the Explanation of Benefits (EOB) from the other insurance along with the claim for reimbursement to CHAMPVA.\n\n- #### My spouse is pregnant when can we add our new child?\n\n- You won’t be able to add them till they have a Social Security Number. Once you get it, be sure to [Claim](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/depends) them as a dependent and **THEN** apply to have them added to CHAMPVA.\n\n- #### Since it takes so long for approval what's going to happen to the bills related to my newborn?\n\n- Don’t worry!

And waiting for any possible surrogate to response would likely result in death or permanent/worsening disability.\n\n- #### Can I file a 1151 claim for care done outside a VA Medical Center (VAMC)?\n\nIt depends…\n\n- **YES** if:\n\n  - The VA referred you to a non-VA facility who conducted the referred procedure;\n\n  - If not for the VA referral the Veteran would not have suffered disability/death; **AND**\n\n  - VAs carelessness, negligence, lack of proper skill, error in judgement, resulted in disability/death.\n\n- #### Can I claim conditions as secondary to a condition that was granted under 1151?\n\n- Yes, you can claim conditions that developed or were aggravated by your 1151 granted condition.\n\n- #### Isn't it a major conflict of interest to have the VA do their own exams? Wouldn't they try to hide their dirty laundry?\n\n- 1151 claims are expressly prohibited to have exams conducted by VA staff conduct the examinations. Which is why all exams/opinions will be done by a 3rd party contractor.\n\n  - If you still feel iffy you can always provide your own properly credentialed medical opinion/examination at your own cost.\n\n[Return to top](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/1151#top)",

Would my amount of the BAH be reduced in kind?\n\n- No, the amount of BAH you would get is **NOT** impacted!\n\n- #### Can I use a VR&E overseas?\n\n- Yes, it is possible to get approval.\n\n- #### The VA severed/reduced my conditions and I no longer meet the requirements to VR&E what happens now?\n\n- If you never applied then nothing.\n\n- If you were actively using it then your benefit will likely end. If you are currently taking classes, you will be allowed to finish the term. You’d be responsible for paying for the next term or you could potentially use a different education benefit (if you wanted to continue).\n\n- #### Do I report untaxed income (such as VA disability) on my Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)?\n\n- **NO!**\n\n- #### Should I bother completing FAFSA or getting scholarships/grants when VA will be paying for classes anyway?"

    "content": "- **YES**! Even if the VA does cover everything you **CAN** generally pocket that money after everything filters through your school!\n\n  - How this works is: School counts up what all fees and tuition you owe and offsets that by any loans, scholarships, grants, etc. If there ends up being a positive balance in your account when everything is said and done you will be refunded that positive balance! If the school applies your loans, scholarships, etc before VA pays the school **THAT IS FINE**! As in the end, the VA will pay the school as appropriate meaning any left over positive balance is still **YOURS**!\n\n    - Tuition assistance through say a job will not result in you pocketing that money. You will in essence be giving the government a discount is all.\n\n    - Scholarships and grants can be pocketed! So be sure to file for them!\n\n- #### Can I get the full BAH amount if I take online only courses?\n\n- No, if full time then you will get ½ the national average BAH rate (assuming you are eligible to get BAH).\n\n  - If you are less than full time, then your allowance will be prorated as appropriate.\n\n- #### Can I get BAH if I am going to a foreign school (in-person)?\n\n- If you are full time then you are entitled to 100% of the national average of the BAH rate (assuming you are eligible to get BAH).\n\n  - If you are less than full time, then your allowance will be prorated as appropriate.\n\n- #### Can I get BAH if I am going to a school in a US Territory (in-person)?\n\n- Technically no… **BUT** if you are full timeyou are entitled to 100% of the Overseas Housing Allowance (OHA) based on the OHA rate of the school (assuming you are eligible to get BAH).\n\n  - If you are less than full time, then your allowance will be prorated as appropriate.\n\n- #### When do I get paid my housing allowance!?\n\n- Two things:\n\n1. VA pays in arrears meaning: You are paid at the end of the of the month for the same month. So - September is paid at the **END** of September, etc."

    "content": "## **Important Things an IMO Should Include**\n\nHere are a few things that your physician should be sure to include in their IMO:\n\n- Letter should only be the length needed. It should be direct and stick to the facts.\n\n- Statement that the physician has reviewed all of the Veteran's relevant/available pre/post medical records as well as of course the Veteran's military medical records.\n\n  - If there are things in your records which detract from a favorable opinion (other things could _also_ cause your condition), these things **SHOULD** be discussed! Why? Because it shows consideration was given to the entirety of the record. To _not_ show consideration shows a lack of attention to detail - which a rater **CAN** use to assign their opinion _lower_ weight!\n- A rationale which explains why the condition is related to the Veteran’s service/service-connected disability.\n\n  - This rationale **MUST** be supported by the evidence of record and have appropriate supporting medical proofs/studies.\n\n  - The rationale _should_ be in reference to a specific diagnosis. Giving an vague opinion on a non-specific condition is a **GREAT** way to get a rater to assign the opinion little to no weight! As failure to provide a diagnosis indicates your medical evidence has not been reviewed or that you have not been properly examined by them.\n\n  - This rationale _should_ also be specific and avoid the use of wide-sweeping generalizations without reference to specific events or duties.\n\n    - Vague statements of “duties” or “hardships” should be avoided; instead expressly state what those duties and hardships were. And then explain how they caused X condition.\n- Statement regarding their opinion\\* as to if the Veteran's current disability is service-connected/or related to a Veteran's service-connected disability.\n\n\n\\*This statement does **NOT** need to be absolute, as it can be really hard to be absolute with the origin of things.\n\nThe language the VA uses and understands regarding statements of service-connection are as follows:\n\n- Is not related: 0% chance disability is service-connected.\n\n- Less likely than not: Less than 50% chance disability is service-connected.\n\n- As likely as not: 50% chance disability is service-connected.\n\n- More likely than not: More than a 50% chance disability is service-connected.\n\n- Is related: 100% chance disability is service-connected.\n\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTES:**\n\n- If your IMO is countering a prior negative opinion, the IMO _should_ also address why the VA examiner is wrong or why your argument is stronger. This will add more weight to the IMO - as it shows a deeper consideration of the medical evidence.\n\n- For VA purposes, if the likelihood is at least 50% then the VA considers it a **POSITIVE** opinion for the purposes of establishing service-connection!\n\n- Statements like “may have”, “possibly caused”, or “could have” do not fit into the above framework and are **NOT** considered favorable!",

During this examination any preexisting issues is recorded. Anything **NOT** recorded during that examination, the VA is instructed to 'presume soundness' - that is, if nothing is recorded that the Veteran came in with nothing wrong!\n\nNow with that said, there are _exceptions_:\n\n- If a _chronic_ condition is diagnosed shortly after service starts, **AND** it could be medically concluded ( _more likely than not_) that this condition existed before service - the VA will just **NOT** assume the condition just popped up during service.\n\n  - This said, it is _still_ possible to get service-connection!\n- If medical evidence shows a condition existed prior to service.\n\n  - Examples include: medical records dated **BEFORE** service or x-rays done in service that show well healed preexisting bone fractures.\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTES:**\n\n- Statements from the Veteran themselves _or_ others that a condition existed **BEFORE** service hold **ZERO WEIGHT**! **UNLESS**, there is medical evidence that backs up those statements!\n\n- If DoD **LOST** your entrance physical paperwork, the VA is to assume you entered into service with no issues (barring the previously mentioned exceptions).\n\n- Periods of [IADT](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/ngr) service; which did **NOT** have an entrance physical conducted prior to the period of service do **NOT** carry this presumption of soundness!\n\n\n* * *\n\n### Setting Up Consideration\n\n```\nSo medical records indicated that a condition existed before service:\n```\n\nIn order for the VA to consider a condition under aggravation of a preexisting (pre-service) condition the VA must establish two things:\n\n1. What the level of severity\\* was **BEFORE** service; and\n\n2. What the level of severity was **DURING/AFTER** service.\n\n\n\\*severity for VA purposes is as established by the [Rating schedule](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/ratingsindex).\n\nFor number one, in _most_ cases (unless you say got a medical waiver), your severity before service will be established as 0%.\n\nNow number two, is where things get tricky for a lot of Veterans...\n\nThe VA **NEEDS** proof that your service made your condition worse! If there are **NO** complaints _or_ treatment made in service for the preexisting condition - [You Lose! Good day sir!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpK36FZmTFY) For the most part...\n\n- _However_, there is _still_ some hope! You can submit [Buddy statements](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/buddy) in support of your claim! Alternatively, if the source of your aggravation is related to combat then you do **NOT** need documentation! You just need to submit a [Personal statement](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/personal) explaining how the injury that aggravated your condition occurred.\n\n- Additionally, if your aggravation occurred as a result of a specialized skill IE parachutist. You can state as much, as it is fairly well established that taking hard landings can mess stuff up.\n\n\n* * *\n\n### Making a Decision\n\nThe VA now armed with elements one and two - can now get a medical opinion on aggravation.\n\nThe VA will now ask a medical professional to provide a medical opinion as to if your military service _permanently_ worsened your preexisting condition at least as likely as not beyond it's natural progression.\n\nIf the opinion is favorable then you are good to go.",

VA disability ratings look at whether an upper extremity (such as the shoulder, arm, or hand), or a lower extremity (such as the hip, knee, or foot) are affected by disabilities that affect both sides.\n\n- Effective April 16, 2023, in the rare circumstances in which the bilateral factor results in the combined disability evaluation being rounded down such as from 95 to 94%. The VA will _automatically_ disable the factor of a condition, so the end result is that the combined evaluation will be 100%!\n\n  - Veterans who were impacted by this change _should_ have been automatically reviewed and if appropriate been awarded [Dependents Educational Assistance (DEA)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/survivorbenefits#dea).\n\n### Applying the Factor\n\nThe bilateral factor will be applied to such bilateral disabilities before other combinations are carried out and the rating for such disabilities including the bilateral factor in this section will be treated as one disability for the purpose of arranging in order of severity and for all further combinations.\n\nFor example, with disabilities evaluated at 60%, 20%, 10% and 10% (the two 10's representing bilateral disabilities), the order of severity would be 60, 21 and 20. The 60 and 21 combine to 68 and the 68 and 20 to give you 74, rounding down to 70% as the final degree of disability.\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTES:**\n\n- [Painful/unstable scars](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/skin#7804) are **NOT** eligible for bilateral consideration.\n\n- [Deep](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/skin#7801) and [Superficial scars](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/skin#7802) **ARE** eligible for bilateral consideration so long as the ratings are **NOT**:\n\n  - Based on whole-body involvement; or\n\n  - Specific to the [Head, face, and/or neck](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/skin#7800).\n- [Hearing](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/ears) and [Eye](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/eyes) disabilities are **NOT** eligible for bilateral consideration.\n\n- [Cranial nerve](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/cranialnerves) conditions are **NOT** eligible for bilateral consideration.\n\n- [Fingers](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/hands) **ARE** eligible for bilateral consideration.\n\n- [Blood flow](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/bloodtubes) conditions involving extremities (such as varicose veins) **ARE** eligible for bilateral consideration.\n\n- [Feet](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/foot) disabilities that have \"bilateral\" in the name and bilateral [Shin splints](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/kneeleg#5262) do **NOT** automatically qualify for the bilateral factor ( **IF** they are the only bilateral eligible condition of that extremity!). **HOWEVER**, if there is another separate disability eligible for bilateral factor that affects the lower extremity - the other disability **AND** the bilateral named condition **WILL** _both_ get the bilateral factor!\n\n  - Bilateral pes planus rated at least 10% alone would **NOT** get the factor.\n\n  - Bilateral pes planus and a right ankle condition both rated at least 10% would **BOTH** get the factor.\n- To tell which conditions have an active bilateral factor, you would need to look at your codesheet.\n\n  - Click [Here](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/cfile) to learn how to request your codesheet.",

Whenever you are 100% combined and your conditions _are_ static, but P&T was **NOT** awarded, the VA will _automatically_ establish an audit (usually within 2 weeks of the rating decision). These audits are conducted by a human who will then give you a grant of P&T, assuming there are no other issues at play.\n\n- If no audit was ever started, you can:\n\n  - Make a [VERA appointment](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vera) and ask if they could have their coach (supervisor) make an EP930 to control for the missed issue of entitlement to depent’s educational assistance;\n\n  - If within a year of **ANY** rating decision; filing a [Higher Level Review (HLR)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals) and cite “Missed issue of dependents’ educational assistance; **_OR_**\n\n  - [File a claim](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vaclaim) for “Entitlement to Dependent’s Educational Assistance, due to being permanent and total”.\n\n  - A rater will review your file and grant if appropriate.",

But if you are _super sure_ the rater messed up - you can file a HLR on the rating decision or take it to BVA.\n\n  - If the rating decision that denied your CUE call was over a year ago you have **NO ABILITY** to call the same CUE again or have it reviewed (officially). Best you can do is file a valid unrelated claim/appeal and mention how you feel a CUE exists. A rater _may then_ look into the matter and call a CUE if they agree.",

Just like [Filing a claim](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vaclaim) you _may_ use the assistance of a [VSO](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vso), lawyer, or an accredited claims agent.\n\nThere are three initial different methods to appeal:\n\n1. Higher-Level Review;\n\n2. Supplemental claim; or\n\n3. Board of Veteran Appeals (BVA).\n\n\nIf your appeal is denied again you **CAN** try another eligible option (see applicable notes).\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTES:**\n\n- If you want to keep your [Effective date](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/edate) (your back pay) you **MUST** file an appeal within **one year** of your claim's decision date! Veterans who fail to do that can only get their original effective date and back pay if there is a [Clear and Unmistakable Error (CUE)](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals#cue).\n\n- Lawyers and claims agents **CANNOT** charge more than **33.3%**\\\\* (excluding expenses\\*\\*) of the Veteran's back pay. Further, they can _only_ get paid if/when the Veteran wins their appeal. Again, VSOs are a resource that is free to the Veteran.\n\n- **PICK A LANE**! You **CANNOT** file multiple appeals/methods for the _same issue_ at the same time ( _without_ first withdrawing the current appeal)!\n\n  - If you filed an appeal to BVA and are tired of waiting you **CANNOT** then file a supplemental claim while the BVA case is pending for the _same issues_.\n\n  - Likewise, you **CANNOT** file an HLR and supplemental claim for the same issue at the same time, etc.\n\n  - You **CAN** file an HLR for [Hearing loss](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/ears) and a supplemental claim for a [Back](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/spine) issue at the same time - since they are _different issues_.\n\n  - **EXCEPTION:**\n\n    - If you have an appeal in at a court above BVA you **_CAN_** then have a separate appeal open for the same issue (just can’t go immediately back to the previous lower court).\n\n\\*The VA will only pay up to 20% automatically from the back pay. If the agreement is over 20% then, the Veteran will need to pay the difference to the lawyer themselves.\n\n\\*\\*Expenses can be things like postage, travel costs, or printing supplies.",

These differences of opinions are **NOT** errors made by the last rater, just a _difference of opinion_.\n\n  - Mere differences of opinions **CANNOT** result in a negative outcome for the Veteran!\n\n    - However, if the previous rater(s) made [Clear and Unmistakable Errors (CUEs)](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals#cue) those errors **CAN** be corrected **EVEN** if negative (with appropriate [Due notice](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/proposed)).\n\nNOTES:\n\n- The Veteran **CANNOT** file a HLR, back-to-back. **HOWEVER**, you **CAN** file a HLR into a supplemental, into another HLR, into a supplemental, etc.\n\n- The Veteran **CANNOT** request an HLR after having a BVA denial.\n\n- The Veteran **MUST** submit their HLR within a year of their claim's decision. Veterans are **NOT** allowed to request an HLR after this time frame.\n\n\n| Question | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Should I choose this? | If you think the evidence the VA has is enough to make a positive decision. |\n| What will happen? | A senior rater will reexamine your claim. |\n\n### Informal Conference\n\nIf you would like to plead your case to the person doing your appeal you may request an informal conference (Section IV of the form).\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTES:**\n\n- If the rater **CAN** make a **POSITIVE** decision based upon the evidence of record the rater **CAN** decide that an informal conference is unnecessary! So do not feel bad if one is **NOT** scheduled!\n\n- You can **ONLY** talk about errors of fact _or_ law as it relates to your appeal during this call.\n\n  - This would include things such as, the VA missing or not considering evidence that was originally submitted with your claim.\n\n  - Ideally, you would have this planned out so you can point out specifically where evidence is: 'Evidence that I had an in-service event can be found on page x of my service treatment records'.\n- Choosing to have an informal conference _may_ result in your appeal taking longer to process.\n\n#### Alternative to Informal Conference\n\nInstead of requesting an informal conference you may submit a [Personal statement](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/personal) with your HLR.\n\nAgain, you can **ONLY** write about errors of fact _or_ law as it relates to your appeal. Remember, you **CANNOT** use this statement as a means to add new evidence to your appeal!\n\n### Submitting an HLR\n\nThere are several options to submit your HLR to the VA:\n\n- Complete and Submit Online Form\n\n  - Click [HERE](https://www.va.gov/decision-reviews/higher-level-review/request-higher-level-review-form-20-0996/start).\n- Submit Paper Form Online\n\n  - Click [HERE](https://eauth.va.gov/accessva/?cspSelectFor=quicksubmit).\n- Via your VSO\n\n- In-person\n\n  - Click [HERE](https://www.va.gov/find-locations/) to locate your nearest Regional Office.\n- Snail Mail\n\n\n> ```\n>  Department of Veterans Affairs\n>  Claims Intake Center\n>  PO Box 4444\n>  Janesville, WI 53547-4444\n> ```\n\n**!!WARNING!!**\n\n- The VA will **NOT** go by the postmark!

A supplemental or BVA appeal _can_ be filed.\n\n### Flowchart of an HLR\n\nBy their design HLRs could be considered as starting in the Rating step of the [Stages of a claim](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/stages) \\- as they are simply a review of the existing evidence and do not allow consideration of new or gathering new evidence. Which is likely why the VA doesn’t give insight into where an HLR is at… since it is either waiting on a DRO or is in short order waiting on authorization.\n\nIf a de facto supplemental claim is opened then it will follow the normal stages of a claim.",

The Veteran **CANNOT** assert that later evidence or evidence that was not given to the VA proved that the Veteran should have been given a favorable decision!\n\nFurther, CUEs **MUST** be considered in the realm of what the laws/regulations/policies were _at the time they were decided_. Veterans **CANNOT** try to apply current laws/regulations/policies to decisions that were made prior to them!\n\nIn order to invoke a CUE the Veteran **MUST** state a CUE has occurred _AND_ **MUST** specify the factual or legal error(s) at issue.\n\n**Seriously, get help!**\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTES:**\n\n- You only get **_ONE_** shot at a CUE per issue. That's it! If you pick something that isn't a CUE and you look back and 'gosh, oh shoot this other thing is the CUE!' That is it. Thanks for playing!\n\n- [Duty to Assist](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/dta) errors can **NEVER** be the basis of a CUE; as only evidence of record at the time of the prior decision can be considered.\n\n- CUEs are a knife that **CAN** cut both ways! Meaning these errors getting corrected **CAN** end up hurting or helping you. It is common for raters to find multiple additional CUEs when you declare a CUE; since a rater who already made at least 1 CUE is generally just gonna mess everything else up!\n\n  - CUEs **CANNOT** sever service-connection for conditions that have been service-connected for at least 10 years (barring findings of the grant itself having no legal basis or fraud).\n\n    - If [Secondary](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/claimtype#secondary) service-connection is granted for a condition **AND** the condition it is secondary to is severed, then the VA will then propose to sever the secondary conditions - assuming there are no other routes to grant them service-connection.\n  - CUEs **CANNOT** reduce an evaluation held for at least 20 years.\n- Forgotten claims (conditions not rated) and missed issues (conditions that should have been inferred or ancillary benefits that were overlooked) are **NOT** CUEs! While they are certainly administrative errors, they are _not_ CUEs because the VA has not erred in making a decision one way or the other.\n\n  - Generally forgotten and missed issues/benefits **CAN** be granted **WITH** back dated effective dates! You just need to point out in the claim/appeal that the VA failed to rate the issues in the previous decision and **EXPLAIN** why the VA should have considered it or that you meet the criteria of a grant previously and the VA failed to grant.\n\n    - Commonly missed ancillary benefits are things like [Special Monthly Compensation (SMC)](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/smc) and [Chapter 35](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/survivorbenefits#dea).\n\n    - Commonly missed inferred conditions are things like [Residual scars](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/skin#7802) and secondary [Nerve issues](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/nerveindex) due to a [Spine](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/spine) condition.\n\n      - NOTE: Inferring issues became policy circa 2014. So missed inferred issues prior to this year **CANNOT** be considered.\n- The VA does not have a form for forgotten claims or CUES; So you can file via a [Personal statement](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/personal) or on a [(20-0995)](http://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-20-0995-ARE.pdf) to help the VA with keeping track of the claim.\n\n- VBA does **NOT** have jurisdiction to call or handle CUEs on _any_ matters decided by BVA or higher courts. Meaning if BVA denied you and it is _somehow_ objectively a CUE, you **MUST** file a timely CAVC appeal or call a CUE against BVA to BVA.\n\n  - This applies to **ANY** rating decisions on the matter made **BEFORE** the BVA or higher court decision on the matter.\n\n    - If you were denied in 2011 for your back and also in 2019, to then be denied again by BVA in 2023. You could **NOT** call a CUE against the 2011 or 2019 decisions (to VBA). As it is assumed BVA has reviewed and found no CUEs in the prior decisions (regarding your back) already.\n  - For information on how to call a CUE against BVA click [HERE](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/38/20.1404).

When the evidence of record shows my claim for increase was received within one year of an [Intent to File (ITF)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/edate#itf). Therefore, the correct effective date of the increased evaluation for PTSD is January 6, 2024. (38 CFR 3.155, 38 CFR 3.400)\n\nOn January 6, 2024, VA received my completed ITF. On October 23, 2024, VA received my completed claim for increase on a VA Form 526EZ, for my PTSD. As my completed claim was received within a year of the ITF, the correct effective date is January 6, 2024.",

Even if the VA does cover everything you **CAN** generally pocket that money after everything filters through your school!\n\n  - How this works is: School counts up what all fees and tuition you owe and offsets that by any loans, scholarships, grants, etc. If there ends up being a positive balance in your account when everything is said and done you will be refunded that positive balance! If the school applies your loans, scholarships, etc before VA pays the school **THAT IS FINE**! As in the end, the VA will pay the school as appropriate meaning any left over positive balance is still **YOURS**!\n\n    - Tuition assistance through say a job will not result in you pocketing that money. You will in essence be giving the government a discount is all.\n\n    - Scholarships and grants can be pocketed! So be sure to file for them!",

This can be done one of three ways:\n\n1\\. Text Message (US phone numbers ONLY)\n\n- Opt-In:\n\n  - Before your semester starts you _should_ receive a text message asking if you would like to submit verification via text. Simply reply back with \"Yes\".\n- Verify:\n\n  - On the last day of the month you will receive a text asking if you are still enrolled. Provide a response and you are set!\n\n2\\. Email\n\n- Opt-In:\n\n  - If you have opted out of the text message option you will automatically be set up for email verification.\n- Verify:\n\n  - On the last day of the month you will get an email asking for you to verify your enrollment. Select the option in the email that applies to you.\n\n3\\. Call the Education Call Center (ECC)\n\n- Opt-In:\n\n  - Not applicable - you just do it.\n- Verify:\n\n  - Call 1-888-442-4551 _or_ 001-918-781-5678 if you are international.\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTES:**\n\n- When you text a response to verify your enrollment, it is **COMMON** to **NOT** get a response for an hour or 2, so do no panic if you do not get a response back right away!\n\n- Failure to verify for 2 months in a row **WILL** result in your MHA being suspended! To restart payments you will need to call the ECC.\n\n### Book & Supply Stipend\n\nYou may also receive a books and supplies stipend up to $1,000 each year (the amount _is_ prorated if you are less than full time).",

No matter how many days are actually in the month. So if that course started on February 21, you would be paid 9/30 the normal MHA amount for the month of February.\n\n  - For more examples click [HERE](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/money#education).\n- People who have courses that start/stop on different dates may have their amount of MHA reduced, if they fall below full time status.\n\n- Round-Out Rule: If during your last semester, your remaining credits to graduate is _less than_ what you need to be considered full time. You **CAN** take non-required courses to fill up your schedule to achieve full time _without_ penalty.\n\n  - If you do **NOT** fill up on courses then your MHA will be **REDUCED** appropriately!\n\n### Rural Benefit\n\nA one time payment of $500 may be payable to certain Veterans relocating from highly rural areas (county with 6 persons or less per square mile (as determined by the most recent decennial census)) and either:\n\n- Physically relocate at least 500 miles to attend an educational institution; or\n\n- Travel by air to physically attend an educational institution if no other land-based transportation exists.\n\n### Kicker AKA Branch College Fund\n\nVeterans who joined an MOS that was listed as having a critical shortage of personnel may have gotten a kicker that increased their benefit.\n\nThe maximum is an additional $950 a month. Which was based upon the length of your initial contract.\n\nThe Veteran will be paid their kicker amount every month. If the Veteran's rate of pursuit is less than full time their kicker amount will be reduced. If the month is less than a full month the kicker will be prorated as well.\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE:**\n\n- If the Veteran does not receive MHA they will **NOT** get their kicker!",

Eligibility for this program is determined by the Selected Reserve components and the VA makes the payments.\n\n* * *\n\n### Benefits\n\nMay be used for college degree and certificate programs, co-op training, technical or vocational courses, flight training, apprenticeships or on-the-job training, high-tech training, licensing and certification tests, entrepreneurship training, certain entrance examinations, and correspondence courses. Remedial, deficiency, and refresher courses may be approved under certain circumstances.\n\nUp to 36 months of education benefits.\n\n* * *\n\n### Kicker AKA Branch College Fund\n\nVeterans who joined an MOS that was listed as having a critical shortage of personnel may have gotten a kicker that increased their benefit.\n\nThe maximum is an additional $350 a month, which was based upon the length of your initial contract.\n\nThe Veteran will be paid their kicker amount as a pro-rated lump sum (for however long the semester is and their percentage of degree of pursuit) at the start of the semester.\n\n* * *\n\n### Eligibility\n\nTo qualify, you must meet the following requirements:\n\n- Have a 6-year obligation to serve in the Selected Reserve signed after June 30, 1985. If you are an officer, you must have agreed to serve 6 years in addition to your original obligation. For some types of training it is necessary to have a 6-year commitment that begins after September 30, 1990.\n\n- Complete your initial Active Duty for Training (IADT). Meet the requirement to receive a high school diploma or equivalency certificate before completing IADT. You may not use 12 hours toward a college degree to meet this requirement.\n\n- Remain in good standing while serving in an active Selected Reserve unit. You will also retain MGIB-SR eligibility if you were discharged from Selected Reserve service due to a disability that was not caused by misconduct. Your eligibility period may be extended if you are ordered to active duty.\n\n\nYour eligibility for this program normally ends the day you leave the Selected Reserve.\n\nAn exception exists if you are mobilized or recalled to Active Duty from your reserve status in which case your eligibility may be extended for the amount of time you are mobilized PLUS 4 months. For example, if you are mobilized for 12 months, your eligibility period is extended for 16 months; 12 months of Active Duty PLUS 4 months. Even if you leave the Reserves after mobilization, you may have additional eligibility under the MGIB-SR.\n\nIf your unit was deactivated during the period beginning October 1, 2007, through September 30, 2014, or you were involuntarily separated for reasons other than misconduct, you will retain your original period of eligibility, which is 14 years from the date of your first 6-year obligation with the Selected Reserves.",

    "content": "**Question:** What does CHAMPVA pay?\n\n**Answer:** In most cases, CHAMPVA's allowable amount (what VA pays) for specific services and supplies—is equivalent to Medicare/TRICARE rates. CHAMPVA has an outpatient deductible ($50 per beneficiary per calendar year or a maximum of $100 per family per calendar year) and a patient cost share of 25% of our allowable amount up to the catastrophic cap ($3,000 per calendar year). Beneficiaries should NOT send checks to VHA OCC for their annual deductible; as claims are processed, charges are automatically credited to individual and family deductible requirements for each calendar year.\n\n- If your provider accepts assignment, which means the provider accepts CHAMPVA, the provider agrees to accept the VA's allowable amount as payment in full. A provider cannot bill you for the difference between the VA's allowable amount and their normally billed amount.\n\n- If the patient has other health insurance, then CHAMPVA pays the lesser of either 75% of the allowable amount after the $50 calendar year deductible is satisfied, or the remainder of the charges and the beneficiary will normally have no cost share.",

    "content": "**Question:** My dependent's application was denied because they are eligible for TRICARE; when they should not be?\n\n**Answer:** 1. Double check to see if DEERS has you listed as eligible or not.\n\n   - Click [HERE](https://tricare.mil/Plans/Eligibility/DEERS/milConnect/Proof) to see if you are listed as eligible for TRICARE coverage.\n2. If you think your eligibility is listed incorrectly call DMDC/DEERS support at 1-800-538-9552 and explain why you think it is wrong IE you are a Gray Area Retiree under 60 years of age.\n\n   - The keyword in their system is “Direct”, it needs to be removed.\n3. With DEERS now updated, submit a question to AskVA to have your denial looked into again. Be sure to include your denial case number/application ID.\n\n   - Click [HERE](https://www.va.gov/contact-us/ask-va/introduction) to use AskVA.\n4. The VA should then review the denial and grant CHAMPVA!",

    "content": "## **Finding a Provider**\n\nCHAMPVA does not have a network of providers. As such it is recommended you visit the [Medicare website](https://www.medicare.gov/) or [TRICARE website](https://tricare.mil/FindDoctor) to find a doctor.\n\nGenerally, providers who accept Medicare, Medicaid, or TRICARE also accept CHAMPVA - but they may not be familiar with the program and incorrectly assume that it is a group health insurance plan rather than a government health care program.\n\nIf the receptionist tells you they don't accept CHAMPVA, ask the billing department - sometimes they are the only ones that _really_ know!\n\n* * *\n\n### Providers that Accept “Assignment” for VA Family Member Programs\n\nWhen you locate a medical provider, confirm that they will participate in the VA family member health care program you belong to. Providers most often refer to participation as \"accepting assignment.\" Providers that accept assignment will bill the VA directly for covered services, items and supplies. Doctors or other providers who accept assignment must accept the VHA Office of Community Care (VHA OCC) allowable amount as payment-in-full and cannot collect additional amounts from you beyond your cost share and deductible.\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE:**\n\n- All hospitals that participate in Medicare, and hospital-based health care professionals who are employed by, or contracted to, such hospitals are **required** by law to accept the VHA OCC allowable amount for inpatient hospital services.\n\n\n* * *\n\n### Providers that do **NOT** Accept “Assignment” for VA Family Member Programs\n\nIf your provider does not accept assignment, you can still see that provider, but be aware that you will likely have to pay the entire charge at the time of service. Additionally, you may be charged more than the VHA OCC allowable amount.\n\nProviders that do not accept assignment are not permitted to file for reimbursement. If you choose to use them, you will have to submit for reimbursement yourself.\n\nTo obtain reimbursement in cases where a VA family member health care program is your only insurance, you will have to submit the itemized bill from the provider along with the appropriate VA form. When the claim is processed, the VA will send you the VHA OCC share of the allowable amount.\n\nWhat this means to you is that when the medical provider does **NOT** accept assignment, your cost will include not only your share of our determined allowable amount, but _also_ any charges over the VA's allowable amount.",

The disability **MUST** be a result of doing something required to complete the program. So for instance getting hurt due to falling down the stairs at home while you are in a program would **NOT** be covered.\n- Error in judgment;\n\n  - Errors involving _negligence_. This does **NOT** include errors that are the result of a misdiagnosis/treatment that are later found to be incorrect. Meaning, doctors are human and medicine is not always an exact science so not every error is due to negligence!\n- Examinations;\n\n- Failure to diagnose or treat;\n\n  - A determination that a physician exercising proper skill and care required by their profession would have reasonably been able to diagnose the condition and provide treatment. The VA **WILL** get a third party to provide a medical opinion on this matter if necessary.\n\n    - This failure **MUST** have resulted in disability or death that would have probably been avoided had a proper diagnosis and treatment been given.\n- Failure to follow the established standard of care;\n\n  - When the standard of care is not followed due to things like carelessness, negligence, lack of skill, etc.\n- Medication;\n\n  - Disability caused by the prescribing of the wrong dosage/medication.\n- Premature discharge.\n\n  - Disability was caused by or aggravated beyond its natural progression due to being released too soon.\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTES:**\n\n- If a disability is due to another patient (non-staff) while **NOT** under care/examination, the disability is **NOT** eligible for compensation under 1151!\n\n- If a disability is the result of the Veteran failing to follow medical instructions and this conclusion can be reasonably supported then a **DENIAL** is warranted!\n\n- If a disability or death is found to be the typical or natural progression of a disease of injury then compensation **CANNOT** be awarded.\n\n- Disabilities that are the result of reasonable care/treatment outcomes are **NOT** eligible for compensation (these are typically spelled out before consent for treatment is given).",

U.S. Veterans’ Admin., 712 F. Supp. 1404 (N.D. Cal. 1989)](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/712/1404/1475736/).\n\nEligible conditions/benefits are to be backdated to the date the claim was initiated or date entitlement [Arose](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/edate#arose); whichever is later. In the case of eligible claims received within a year of separation, the backdate is to either the date after separation or date entitlement arose; whichever is later.\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTES:**\n\n- The limitation regarding liberalizing law (effective dates can be no earlier than the date of the law/policy change) does **NOT** apply to grants under 38 CFR 3.816!\n\n- The appeal does **NOT** need to be continuously pursued!\n\n- If a covered condition was later granted on [Appeal](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals) via a [Secondary](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/claimtype#secondary), [Direct](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/serviceconnection#direct), different [Presumptive](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/presumptive), etc. basis - the VA is allowed to reopen the issue and award an earlier effective date via 38 CFR 3.816.\n\n- Claims/appeals do **NOT** need to have named Agent Orange as the basis of the condition!\n\n  - If for example you said originally that your lung cancer was due to radiation exposure, you can still be considered a Nehmer class member.\n\n* * *\n\n### Eligibility\n\nVeteran was exposed to Agent Orange and developed a covered condition _or_ their survivor claimed entitlement to a related [Death Benefit](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/deathbenefits), or [Survivor benefit](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/survivorbenefits) and was **DENIED** from September 25, 1985 to the date **BEFORE** the condition became presumptive.\n\n- To see the list of when conditions became presumptive click [HERE](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/edate#lib).\n\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE:**\n\n- **ONLY** Veteran’s whose Agent Orange exposure happened _in_ Vietnam **_OR_** its waters (to include its waterways/ports (Brown and Blue Water Navy)) **_ARE_** subject to Nehmer! If exposure happened in a different country, Nehmer **CANNOT** be applied. [(N.D. Cal. 2020)](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/california/candce/3:1986cv06160/56297/492/)\n\n\n**SPECIAL NOTE:**\n\n- From September 25, 1985, if **ANY** claim or appeal was decided **AND** there was medical evidence of record that showed a _diagnosis_ of a condition which **BECAME** presumptive. **EVEN IF NOT AT ISSUE** in the claim/appeal, the now presumptive condition is eligible for Nehmer! (see example 3 below)\n\n\n* * *\n\n### Covered Conditions\n\nNehmer applies to the conditions named in [38 CFR 3.309(e)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/38/3.309) **BESIDES** chloracne. If the condition is **NOT** named in the regulation then till such time it is added officially, the Nehmer stipulation **CANNOT** be applied!\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTES:**\n\n- When a new presumptive condition is added to 38 CFR 3.309(e), the VA is **REQUIRED** to review prior decisions and grant earlier effective dates as appropriate.\n\n  - So in theory, a person would never need to file a claim for an earlier effective date…\n- By their nature, claims for conditions filed **AFTER** they became presumptive are **NOT** subject to Nehmer.\n\n  - However, these claims are _still_ eligible for consideration under [Liberalizing law](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/edate#lib).\n- Currently hypertension and MGUS are **NOT** conditions eligible for Nehmer consideration.\n\n\n* * *\n\n#### Example 1 (Nehmer Stipulation Applies)\n\nAO Vietnam Veteran’s initial claim for lung cancer was received on October 20, 1992, and denied on December 23, 1992. Medical evidence showed a diagnosis of lung cancer in September 1992. The Veteran filed an appeal in March 2025 with evidence of the prior diagnosis.\n\nNOTE: Lung cancer became presumptive for AO June 9, 1994.\n\nRESULT:  SC for lung cancer is granted effective the date the initial claim was received, October 20, 1992.\n\n* * *\n\n#### Example 2 (Nehmer Stipulation Does **NOT** Apply)\n\nAO Vietnam Veteran’s initial claim for diabetes was received on June 22, 1984, and denied on February 2, 1985. The Veteran filed an appeal on January 6, 2025. The earliest medical evidence showing a diagnosis of diabetes type II was in January 10, 1980.\n\nNOTE: Diabetes became presumptive for AO May 08, 2001.\n\nRESULT: SC for diabetes is granted January 6, 2024. Nehmer does not apply in this context as the original claim was denied **BEFORE** September 25, 1985. However, liberalizing law does still apply, as Veteran was diagnosed before the condition was presumptive.\n\n* * *\n\n#### Example 3 (Nehmer Stipulation Applies)\n\nAO Vietnam Veteran files a claim for jaw pain in June 4, 2008. Medical records submitted with claim show a diagnosis of coronary artery disease dated May 10, 1999. December 5, 2020 Veteran files a claim for coronary artery disease.\n\nNOTE: Coronary artery disease became presumptive for AO Aug 31, 2010.\n\nRESULT: SC for coronary artery disease is granted the date a claim was made during which time there was evidence of record showing the diagnosis of the now presumptive condition, June 4, 2008.\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE:**\n\n- **MOST** raters will **MISS THIS**!",

    "content": "**Question:** The VA severed/reduced my conditions and I no longer meet the requirements to VR&E what happens now?\n\n**Answer:** If you never applied then nothing.\n\n- If you were actively using it then your benefit will likely end. If you are currently taking classes, you will be allowed to finish the term. You’d be responsible for paying for the next term or you could potentially use a different education benefit (if you wanted to continue).",

    "content": "**Question:** Should I bother completing FAFSA or getting scholarships/grants when VA will be paying for classes anyway?\n\n**Answer:** **YES**! Even if the VA does cover everything you **CAN** generally pocket that money after everything filters through your school!\n\n  - How this works is: School counts up what all fees and tuition you owe and offsets that by any loans, scholarships, grants, etc. If there ends up being a positive balance in your account when everything is said and done you will be refunded that positive balance! If the school applies your loans, scholarships, etc before VA pays the school **THAT IS FINE**! As in the end, the VA will pay the school as appropriate meaning any left over positive balance is still **YOURS**!\n\n    - Tuition assistance through say a job will not result in you pocketing that money. You will in essence be giving the government a discount is all.\n\n    - Scholarships and grants can be pocketed! So be sure to file for them!",

Employment Through Long-Term Services\n\n5. Independent Living\n\n\n* * *\n\n### 1\\. Reemployment\n\nAssists Veterans in regaining employment with their _former_ employer. This may be accomplished by providing the employer assistance/equipment in accommodating the Veteran.\n\nNOTE:\n\n- This track may only be used if it is determined the Veteran's _former_ job is still suitable considering their existing disabilities.\n\n\n* * *\n\n### 2\\. Rapid Access to Employment\n\nFor Veterans who already have the skills, experience, and education needed to gain employment in their desired field. But they may be having difficulties in finding employment for one reason or another.\n\nExamples of some of the tools that will be made available include:\n\n- Assistance in job hunting\n\n- Career counseling\n\n- Interview prepping\n\n- Resume creation/modification\n\n\nNOTE:\n\n- If the Veteran requires some short term certification training. It may be possible to obtain it via this track.\n\n\n* * *\n\n### 3\\. Self-Employment\n\nWant to be your own boss? This track is all you.\n\nYour counseling team will be there to assist you in developing a viable long term business plan.\n\nExamples of some of the tools that will be made available include:\n\n- Analysis of your business concept\n\n- Training in small-business operations, marketing, and finances\n\n- Tuition assistance to obtain needed certifications/licenses for the business\n\n- Financial assistance to cover applicable fees as well as related business startup costs\n\n\nNOTES:\n\n- This track is more-so for those who have limited access to traditional employment, need flexible work schedules, or need a more accommodating work environment due to their disabling conditions or other life circumstances.\n\n- The VA **MUST** approve your business plan _before_ they start offering you training/funding.\n\n\n* * *\n\n### 4\\. Employment Through Long-Term Services\n\nFor Veterans who need additional training or assistance to obtain and maintain long-term employment.\n\nExamples of some of the tools that will be made available include:\n\n- Assistance in job hunting\n\n- Career guidance\n\n- Higher level education - includes both undergraduate and graduate level degrees\n\n- Job skill assessment\n\n- Job-market evaluation\n\n- Resume creation/modification\n\n- Apprenticeship, on-the-job training, and volunteer opportunities\n\n- Vocational Training\n\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE:**\n\n- Again, VRE is primarily an employment program and **NOT** an educational program. As such, if you can reasonably obtain employment in your desired field with your current educational attainment. You may find it very difficult to get approved for something like a Masters degree.\n\n\n* * *\n\n### 5\\. Independent Living\n\nFor Veterans who's service-connected disabilities limit their ability to perform activities of daily living (like bathing, dressing, accessing the community, and interacting with others) and can’t return to work right away.\n\nVeterans _may_ use this track in conjunction with trying to obtain employment.\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE:**\n\n- This track has _advanced_ eligibility requirements:\n\n  - Must have a serious employment handicap; **AND**\n\n  - Disabilities prevent you from obtaining or returning to work; **AND**\n\n  - You need services to live as independently as possible.\n\nExamples of some of the tools that will be made available include:\n\n- Evaluation and counseling to identify your needs and goals\n\n- Referral to support resources\n\n- Evaluation to see if you're eligible for the VR&E home adaptation grant. This ~$90,0000 grant is part of your rehabilitation plan to improve accessibility features in your home.\n\n- Guidance to help you understand if you’re eligible for [Other adaptive-housing programs](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/housing#adapt).",

Acceptable Lay Evidence |  | Lay evidence is acceptable for the purpose of establishing service incurrence or aggravation, in the absence of service treatment records (STRs), for a combat Veteran or former prisoner of war (FPOW), if the evidence<br>- is satisfactory<br>  <br>- is consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of combat or FPOW internment, and<br>  <br>- can prevail in spite of the absence of official records showing incurrence or aggravation of the disease or injury during service.<br>  <br>**_Important_**:  Medical evidence of a link to a current condition is still needed to establish service connection.<br>A non-combat Veteran’s lay statements may be acceptable for establishing service incurrence or aggravation but must be weighed against other evidence in the claims folder including the absence of military records documenting or supporting the statements.<br>**_References_**:  For more information on<br>- considering evidence for combat-related disabilities, see [M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 2.A](https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018/content/554400000180481/M21-1-Part-V-Subpart-ii-Chapter-2-Section-A-Direct-Service-Connection-SC-and-Service-Incurrence-of-an-Injury)<br>- considering lay evidence, see [38 U.S.C. 1154(a)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/38/1154)<br>- a non-combat Veteran’s statements, see [_Bardwell v. Shinseki_](https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018/content/554400000014674/Bardwell-v-Shinseki-Aug-17-2010-24-VetApp-36), 24 Vet.App. 36 (2010), and<br>- evaluating STRs, see [M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 1.A.3.i](https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018/content/554400000014383/M21-1-Part-V-Subpart-ii-Chapter-1-Section-A-Principles-of-Reviewing-and-Weighing-Evidence). |\n\n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ### V.ii.1.B.2.b.  When to Use Lay Evidence |  | Lay evidence is generally afforded probative value if it is provided by a person who has knowledge of facts or circumstances and conveys matters that can be observed and described by a lay person. <br>The value accorded to other types of lay evidence depends on such factors as<br>- the accuracy or clarity of the individual’s memory<br>  <br>- direct personal knowledge or experience<br>  <br>- recency of the event, and<br>  <br>- the competence of the reporting person.<br>  <br>A medically-untrained individual is not usually competent to offer a medical opinion regarding the etiology of disorders and such an opinion is generally assigned little probative weight.<br>**_References_**:  For more information on<br>- using lay evidence to support a claim, see [_Espiritu v. Derwinski_](https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018/content/554400000073149/Espiritu-v-Derwinski-Jun-16-1992-2-VetApp-492-1992), 2 Vet.App. 492 (1992), and<br>- definition of lay evidence, see [38 CFR 3.159(a)(2)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=e05a20cdd9805601c9123df74a4fa27d&mc=true&node=se38.1.3_1159&rgn=div8). |\n\n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ### V.ii.1.B.2.c.  Descriptions of Symptoms as Evidence |  | A claimant’s own statement, covering in sufficient detail a condition that is within the claimant's ability to describe, such as their own symptoms, may to that extent constitute evidence.<br>**_Rationale_**:  While such statements have self-serving aspects, the claimant is often the most qualified source to describe the circumstances of the disabling effects of the disease or injury. |",

Obtaining records\n\n2. Providing a medical examination/obtaining medical opinions\n\n\nBut let it be stated that first and foremost to the duty to assist, is VAs _duty to notify_.\n\nThis foundational notice is known as a ['5103 notice'](https://www.benefits.va.gov/COMPENSATION/notice.asp) and explains what evidence is needed to properly support your [Claim](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vaclaim)/ [Appeal](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals). Failure to send this notice is a common duty to assist error. But, if you filed a claim via [va.gov](https://www.va.gov/) or the [VA Form 21-526EZ](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-21-526EZ-ARE.pdf) then that notice is 'baked-in' and the VA does not need to send it separately.\n\n**_SPECIAL NOTE:_**\n\n- In the following cases (not a complete list) the VA will stop/not provide duty to assist:\n\n  - Obtaining evidence would not reasonably further the claim;\n\n  - Claims that are inherently incredible or clearly lack merit;\n\n  - Claimant lacks qualifying service, Veteran status, or other legal eligibility; or\n\n  - Filing for a benefit for which there is no entitlement as a matter of law.",

    "content": "## How the PACT Act affects Camp Lejeune claims and related benefits\n\n- Expand all\n- Collapse all\n\n### How does the PACT Act affect people who lived at Camp Lejeune?\n\nSection 804 of the Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act addresses people who lived at Camp Lejeune. This law is also called the Camp Lejeune Justice Act of 2022.\n\nThis law allows Veterans, survivors, and families to file for appropriate relief for harm caused by exposure to the contaminated water at Camp Lejeune.\n\nYou (or your legal representative) can file for relief under this authority if either of these descriptions is true:\n\n- You lived, worked, or were otherwise exposed at Camp Lejeune for at least 30 days total between August 1, 1953, and December 31, 1987, **or**\n- Your mother lived, worked, or was otherwise exposed at Camp Lejeune for at least 30 days total between August 1, 1953, and December 31, 1987, while pregnant with you\n\n**Note:** The PACT Act doesn’t affect VA benefits related to Camp Lejeune. The law does expand VA health care and benefits for Veterans exposed to burn pits and other toxic substances.\n\n[Learn more about the PACT Act and your VA benefits](https://www.va.gov/resources/the-pact-act-and-your-va-benefits \"The PACT Act and your VA benefits\")\n\n### How can I file for relief under the Camp Lejeune Justice Act?\n\nYou (or your legal representative) can start by filing an administrative claim with the Department of the Navy.\n\nYou can follow the Navy’s process to seek an award of relief for your claim. You may also be able to choose the Department of the Navy’s new elective option to get a faster settlement decision directly from the Navy. Or if the Navy denies your claim or you wait longer than 6 months for a decision, you can file a lawsuit in the Eastern District of North Carolina.\n\n[Learn how to file for Camp Lejeune relief on the Navy's website](https://www.navy.mil/clja/)\n\n### Will filing for relief affect my VA benefits or health care?\n\nNo. Filing for relief under the Camp Lejeune Justice Act of 2022 won’t affect your eligibility for VA disability or health care benefits.\n\nIf the court awards you relief under this law (or if a court awarded relief in the past), this won’t affect the amount of your VA disability payments or your eligibility for VA health care.  A settlement through the Department of the Navy’s elective option process also won’t affect your VA benefits or health care in any way.\n\n### Will my VA benefits affect my award from a lawsuit?\n\nYes, in some cases. Your benefits may affect your award if both of these descriptions are true:\n\n- A court awards you relief as a result of a lawsuit filed under the Camp Lejeune Justice Act of 2022, **and**\n\n- You already get VA benefits or health care related to exposure to water at Camp Lejeune\n\n\nThe court must reduce (or “offset”) the award by the amount of any related disability award, payment, or benefit we provided to you or your legal representative from a lawsuit. If you choose the elective option claim process, this offset doesn’t apply to you.\n\nVA benefits that aren’t related to exposure to contaminated water at Camp Lejeune won’t affect your award from a lawsuit.\n\n### How can I check the status of my lawsuit under the Camp Lejeune Justice Act of 2022?\n\nYou can contact the Department of Justice by phone or email:\n\n- Call [202-353-4426](tel:+12023534426) ( [TTY: 711](tel:711)), **or**\n- Send an email to [camplejeune.pactact@usdoj.gov](mailto:camplejeune.pactact@usdoj.gov)",

[VA Form 21-10210](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-21-10210-ARE.pdf) is the latest and greatest form they should use.\n\n- Keep it brief and to the point, remember BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front). The rater doesn't have time to get lost in a great story about the time Pvt. Reddit put LT's patrol cap in the freezer, after filling it with water. (But the people at [r/Veterans](https://www.reddit.com/r/Veterans) do.)\n\n- Quantify (state numbers) when possible. Which sounds better?:\n\n1. Veteran's headaches are so severe s(he) has to lay down for most of the day. These headaches occur _fairly frequently_; **OR**\n\n2. Veteran's headaches are so severe s(he) has to lay down for most of the day. These headaches occur at _least three times a week_.\n- Unless your buddy is a licensed physician in the relevant area of medicine, they should **NOT** try to diagnosis the Veteran. Remember, have them stick to the facts of their _direct_ observations! But if your buddy _does just so happen to be a licensed physician in the relevant area of medicine_. Have them complete a [Disability Benefit Questionnaires (DBQs)](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/dbq) and/or an [Independent Medical Opinion (IMO)/Nexus Letter](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/imo).\n\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTES:**\n\n- Do **NOT** tell your buddy _what_ to write!! They must write what they **SAW** in relation to you and your claim. So if they did _not_ witness anything or they recall something differently.... Well that's that!\n\n- Again… the buddy can **ONLY** write about something they have first-hand experience (they saw you get hurt, remember you having issues, seen you have current issues, etc.). They **CANNOT** write about something they heard or learned about second hand (even if the person they heard something from is now dead).\n\n  - Hearsay itself does not help prove anything. So a statement of ““X told me Buddy had been involved in a vehicle accident and was given a cast.” Provides **NO** value to a claim/appeal.\n- But **DO** tell them _how_ to write the letter.\n\n- If your buddy for whatever reason does not want to use the VA form. Ensure that they write \"I CERTIFY THAT I have completed this statement and that its information is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.\" Directly above where they sign and date their letter. In addition to providing their contact information.",

How you know the Veteran and for how long you've known them. (If you served in the military together, providing information such as your unit(s) and dates you served together will help strengthen your statement by providing more credibility.)\n\n2. Details about the in-service event that caused the injury or illness.\n\n3. How the Veteran was impacted by the event. Any changes in physical/mental health?\n- Help prove severity of your disability:\n\n1. How you know the Veteran and for how long you've known them.\n\n2. What are the Veteran’s current symptoms? How do their disabilit(ies) interfere with their job, social life, things they can no longer do, etc.\n\n* * *\n\n### Example 1 (Witnessed an Event)\n\nMy name is \\[Buddy\\], and I served together with Sgt. Reddit in B Co XXX at Ft. Camp from September 20XX to July 20XX. During that time I was Sgt. Reddit's Plt leader.\n\nSgt. Reddit was an all around good soldier for most of that time. That was until April 20XX when she started having issues, such as showing up late to work, underage drinking, \\[etc\\]. This resulted in Sgt. Reddit receiving nonjudicial punishment.\n\nIt was not until July 20XX that Sgt. Reddit confided in me that she was sexually assaulted by another service member who was from another company.\n\nUpon learning this information I immediately reported the information to the Company Commander. However, I am unaware if that information was acted upon as I separated from the Army shortly thereafter.\n\n* * *\n\n### Example 2 (Witnessed an Event)\n\nMy name is \\[Buddy\\], and I served with Cpl. Reddit for 2 years. During that time I deployed with them to Afghanistan for 1 year. We both served in the same squad.\n\nPrior to our 1 year deployment to Afghanistan in Feb 201X, he was a high achieving soldier who excelled in many areas. He was very outgoing, energetic, and had no discipline problems.\n\nOn June 201X, our squad was doing routine patrols when the vehicle immediately...\n\nAfter that event I noticed that Cpl. Reddit was always on edge, \\[other examples of symptoms\\].\n\nIt is my belief that the events that occurred that day had a lasting negative affect on Cpl. Reddit's mental health.\n\n* * *\n\n### Example 3 (Witnessed an Event)\n\nI served with Sgt. Guy as their platoon leader while we were both assigned to Ft. Bragg in 1991.\n\nIn early July 1991, during vehicle maintenance I saw Sgt. Guy get his right hand smashed under a HMMWV hood. I vividly recall his middle and ring fingers swelling and changing colors. While we got him ice, I don’t think he went to medical over it. I eventually left Ft. Bragg in November 1993, I remember Sgt. Guys fingers were still messed up at that time. While his fingers were no longer swollen, they looked bent out of shape and his salutes always looked wrong.\n\n* * *\n\n### Example 4 (Witness to Severity)\n\nI \\[Friend\\] have known \\[Veteran\\] for 4 years. We used to get together 3-4 times a month to do activities like walking and bowling. For the past 6 or so months I have noticed a decline in \\[Veteran\\]'s mobility.\n\n\\[Veteran\\] is no longer able to walk for as long or as far as they used to. I see that after physical activities that their back becomes very stiff which makes it difficult for them to move around.\n\nIt has gotten to the point now that I notice him having difficulties getting into and out of vehicles. This June, when \\[Veteran\\] was walking back to their car I saw them drop their keys. He attempted to bend down to get them but he was barely able to bend his back. In the end, I had to get his keys for him.\n\n\\[Veteran\\] has pretty much stopped doing physical activities with me. We maybe go on walks once a month now. Due to their declining physical condition.",

    "content": "Nehmer Class Members (38 CFR 3.816)\nEligible claimants are entitled to earlier Effective date(s) based on the class action lawsuit of Nehmer v. U.S. Veterans’ Admin., 712 F. Supp. 1404 (N.D. Cal. 1989).\n\nEligible conditions/benefits are to be backdated to the date the claim was initiated or date entitlement Arose; whichever is later. In the case of eligible claims received within a year of separation, the backdate is to either the date after separation or date entitlement arose; whichever is later.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES:\n\nThe limitation regarding liberalizing law (effective dates can be no earlier than the date of the law/policy change) does NOT apply to grants under 38 CFR 3.816!\n\nThe appeal does NOT need to be continuously pursued!\n\nIf a covered condition was later granted on Appeal via a Secondary, Direct, different Presumptive, etc. basis - the VA is allowed to reopen the issue and award an earlier effective date via 38 CFR 3.816.\n\nClaims/appeals do NOT need to have named Agent Orange as the basis of the condition!\n\nIf for example you said originally that your lung cancer was due to radiation exposure, you can still be considered a Nehmer class member.\n\nEligibility\nVeteran was exposed to Agent Orange and developed a covered condition or their survivor claimed entitlement to a related Death Benefit, or Survivor benefit and was DENIED from September 25, 1985 to the date BEFORE the condition became presumptive.\n\nTo see the list of when conditions became presumptive click HERE.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE:\n\nONLY Veteran’s whose Agent Orange exposure happened in Vietnam OR its waters (to include its waterways/ports (Brown and Blue Water Navy)) ARE subject to Nehmer! If exposure happened in a different country, Nehmer CANNOT be applied. (N.D. Cal. 2020)\n\nSPECIAL NOTE:\n\nFrom September 25, 1985, if ANY claim or appeal was decided AND there was medical evidence of record that showed a diagnosis of a condition which BECAME presumptive. EVEN IF NOT AT ISSUE in the claim/appeal, the now presumptive condition is eligible for Nehmer! (see example 3 below)\n\nCovered Conditions\nNehmer applies to the conditions named in 38 CFR 3.309(e) BESIDES chloracne. If the condition is NOT named in the regulation then till such time it is added officially, the Nehmer stipulation CANNOT be applied!\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES:\n\nWhen a new presumptive condition is added to 38 CFR 3.309(e), the VA is REQUIRED to review prior decisions and grant earlier effective dates as appropriate.\n\nSo in theory, a person would never need to file a claim for an earlier effective date…\n\nBy their nature, claims for conditions filed AFTER they became presumptive are NOT subject to Nehmer.\n\nHowever, these claims are still eligible for consideration under Liberalizing law.\n\nCurrently hypertension and MGUS are NOT conditions eligible for Nehmer consideration.\n\nExample 1 (Nehmer Stipulation Applies)\nAO Vietnam Veteran’s initial claim for lung cancer was received on October 20, 1992, and denied on December 23, 1992. Medical evidence showed a diagnosis of lung cancer in September 1992. The Veteran filed an appeal in March 2025 with evidence of the prior diagnosis.\n\nNOTE: Lung cancer became presumptive for AO June 9, 1994.\n\nRESULT:  SC for lung cancer is granted effective the date the initial claim was received, October 20, 1992.\n\nExample 2 (Nehmer Stipulation Does NOT Apply)\nAO Vietnam Veteran’s initial claim for diabetes was received on June 22, 1984, and denied on February 2, 1985. The Veteran filed an appeal on January 6, 2025. The earliest medical evidence showing a diagnosis of diabetes type II was in January 10, 1980.\n\nNOTE: Diabetes became presumptive for AO May 08, 2001.\n\nRESULT: SC for diabetes is granted January 6, 2024. Nehmer does not apply in this context as the original claim was denied BEFORE September 25, 1985. However, liberalizing law does still apply, as Veteran was diagnosed before the condition was presumptive.\n\nExample 3 (Nehmer Stipulation Applies)\nAO Vietnam Veteran files a claim for jaw pain in June 4, 2008. Medical records submitted with claim show a diagnosis of coronary artery disease dated May 10, 1999. December 5, 2020 Veteran files a claim for coronary artery disease.\n\nNOTE: Coronary artery disease became presumptive for AO Aug 31, 2010.\n\nRESULT: SC for coronary artery disease is granted the date a claim was made during which time there was evidence of record showing the diagnosis of the now presumptive condition, June 4, 2008.",

What do I do?\n\n**Answer:** While uncommon, sometimes raters overlook a grant of P&T. Whenever you are 100% combined and your conditions _are_ static, but P&T was **NOT** awarded, the VA will _automatically_ establish an audit (usually within 2 weeks of the rating decision). These audits are conducted by a human who will then give you a grant of P&T, assuming there are no other issues at play.\n\n- If no audit was ever started, you can:\n\n  - Make a [VERA appointment](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vera) and ask if they could have their coach (supervisor) make an EP930 to control for the missed issue of entitlement to depent’s educational assistance;\n\n  - If within a year of **ANY** rating decision; filing a [Higher Level Review (HLR)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals) and cite “Missed issue of dependents’ educational assistance; **_OR_**\n\n  - [File a claim](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vaclaim) for “Entitlement to Dependent’s Educational Assistance, due to being permanent and total”.\n\n  - A rater will review your file and grant if appropriate.",

    "content": "# 1\\. Q: What is the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act of 2019?\n\nA: Public Law 116-23, the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act of 2019, was signed into law on June 25, 2019. The law takes effect January 1, 2020. The law states that Veterans who served offshore of the Republic of Vietnam between January 9, 1962, and May 7, 1975, are presumed to have been exposed to herbicides such as Agent Orange and may be entitled to service connection for conditions related to that exposure.\n\nTo be eligible for presumption of service connection based on herbicide exposure, the Veteran must have served in the offshore waters of the Republic of Vietnam not more than 12-nautical miles seaward of a line commencing on the southwestern demarcation of the waters of Vietnam and Cambodia and intersecting at the following points.\n\n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Points Geographic Names | Latitude North | Longitude East |\n| At Hon Nhan Island, Tho Chu Archipelago Kien Giang Province | 9°15.0' | 103°27.0' |\n| At Hon Da Island southeast of Hon Khoai Island Minh Hai Province At Tai Lon Islet, Con Dao Islet in Con Dao-Vung Toa Special Sector | 8°22.8' | 104°52.4' |\n|  | 8°37.8' | 106°37.5' |\n| At Bong Lai Islet, Con Dao Islet | 8°38.9 | 106°40.3' |\n| At Bay Canh Islet, Con Dao Islet | 8°39.7' | 106°42.1' |\n| At Hon Hai Islet (Phu Qui group of islands) Thuan Hai Province | 9°58.0 | 109°5.0' |\n| At Hon Doi Islet, Thuan Hai Province | 12°39.0' | 109°28.0' |\n| At Dai Lanh point, Phu Khanh Province | 12°53.8' | 109°27.2' |\n| At Ong Can Islet, Phu Khanh Province | 13°54.0' | 109°21.0' |\n| At Ly Son Islet, Nghia Binh Province | 15°23.1' | 109° 9.0' |\n| At Con Co Island, Binh Tri Thien Province | 17°10.0' | 107°20.6' |\n\n# 2\\. Q: What is the Procopio decision?\n\nA: The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit rendered a decision on January 29, 2019 that ruled in favor of the Veteran in Alfred Procopio, Jr., v. Robert Wilkie. In the decision, the Court held that by the phrase “Republic of Vietnam” in the Agent Orange Act of 1991, Congress intended to extend presumption of herbicide exposure to Veterans who served within the 12-nautical mile territorial sea of the Republic of Vietnam. The Procopio decision was superseded by Public Law 116-23, Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act of 2019 which was signed into law on June 25, 2019.\n\n# 3\\. Q: Are there Veterans who would receive benefits under Procopio who will not be eligible under Public Law 116-23?\n\nA: VA recognizes that there are differences between the location parameters as outlined in Procopio and the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act of 2019. Because Congress established the exact longitude and latitude coordinates in the new law, VA must now review the policy implications to ensure that all eligible Blue Water Navy Veterans serving with the applicable regions as outlined in the new law are considered. Although some claimants may have been eligible for benefits under the Procopio ruling, VA is utilizing the stay on deciding claims to ensure that VA processes and adjudicates all Blue Water Navy claims in an accurate and orderly fashion by carefully implementing the “broad and comprehensive” definition of service in the Republic of Vietnam that Congress intended.\n\n4. Q: How does this law change eligibility for the presumption for Agent Orange exposure claims?\n\nA: The law expands the population of eligible Veterans who served in the offshore waters of the Republic of Vietnam as specified in Public Law 116-23.\n\n# 5\\. Q: When does the new law go into effect?\n\nA: The Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act of 2019 will take effect on January 1, 2020. Veterans, survivors and dependents can file claims at any time, and a decision will be made after the law is implemented. Blue Water Navy claims and appeals currently in process have been placed on hold (stayed) until the new law goes into effect. The Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act authorizes VA to begin deciding Blue Water Navy related claims on January 1, 2020. By staying claims decisions until January 1, 2020, VA is exercising authority conferred by the law that Congress wrote and passed.\n\n# 6\\. Q: Do I need to prove contact with an herbicide such as Agent Orange?\n\nA: No. You don’t need to show that you came into contact with an herbicide such as Agent Orange. Congress announced that conditions on the list of presumptive diseases will be presumed to have been caused by herbicide exposure to include toxins such as Agent Orange among others through service in the Republic of Vietnam, including offshore waters as defined by the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act of 2019.\n\n7. Q: Are Blue Water Navy Veterans and survivors excluded from filing for disability benefits related to herbicide exposure to include toxins such as Agent Orange?\n\nA: No. Blue Water Navy Veterans have always been able to file for benefits for disabilities related to herbicide exposure to include toxins such as Agent Orange. VA previously had a policy of applying the presumption of herbicide exposure when a Veteran and/or survivor could provide evidence that the Veteran served on a vessel, while the vessel: (1) temporarily entered the Republic of Vietnam’s inland waterways, (2) docked to shore or pier, or (3) otherwise sent crewmembers ashore while operating on close coastal waters.",

    "content": "8. Q: Why had VA not applied the presumption of exposure to Blue Water Navy Veterans in the past?\n\nA: VA interpreted the statutory phrase “served in the Republic of Vietnam” to refer to service on land or on the inland waterways of Vietnam, but not to include service in the waters offshore or in the airspace above Vietnam. The Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act of 2019 clarifies Congress’ intent to expand the population of Veterans presumed to have been exposed to herbicides to include toxins such as Agent Orange.\n\n# 9\\. Q: What is the difference between Brown Water and Blue Water Navy Veterans?\n\nA: “Brown Water” Veterans are those who served on U.S. Naval and Coast Guard vessels which navigated the inland waterways and rivers of the Republic of Vietnam. “Blue Water” Veterans are those who served offshore of the Republic of Vietnam, including 12-nautical miles seaward of a line commencing on the southwestern demarcation line of the waters of Vietnam and Cambodia and intersecting coordinates as described in the law.\n\n10. Q: What health conditions are associated with herbicide exposure to include toxins such as Agent Orange 1?\n\nA: Fourteen diseases are currently on the presumptive list for Agent Orange.\n\nAmyloid light-chain (AL) amyloidosis Chloracne, or other acneform disease consistent with chloracne All Chronic B-cell leukemias (including, but not limited to, hairy-cell leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia) Diabetes mellitus, Type 2 Lymphoma, Hodgkin’s, formerly known as Hodgkin’s disease\n\n• Multiple myeloma Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin’s\n\n• Peripheral neuropathy, early-onset Porphyria cutanea tarda\n\n• Prostate Cancer Respiratory cancers (cancer of the lung, bronchus, larynx, or trachea) Soft-tissue sarcoma (other than osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, Kaposi’s sarcoma, or mesothelioma) Ischemic heart disease Parkinson's disease\n\n1 This list of conditions is eligible for presumptive service connection under 38 CFR 3.309(e); however, a Veteran may be entitled to service connection on a direct basis under 38 CFR 3.303, if herbicide exposure is established and scientific or medical evidence establishes that the claimed condition is medically associated with dioxin exposures.\n\n# 11\\. Q: What will the effective date be for Blue Water Navy Veteran claims?\n\nA: Presumptive disabilities granted because of the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act of 2019 will generally be based on the date of receipt of the claim. If you had a previously denied claim and you resubmit your claim, the effective date will be determined on a case-by-case basis.\n\n# 12\\. Q: How will the previously denied claims be reviewed under the new law?\n\nA: Veterans and survivors who had an herbicide exposure claim with service connection of one or more presumptive conditions denied in the past, are urged to file a new claim. They should provide any new and relevant information regarding the claim such as dates their vessel traveled within the offshore waters of the Republic of Vietnam or updated medical information. Claims that are currently in the VA review process or under appeal are placed on hold and will be automatically reviewed after January 1, 2020. Claims should be submitted on a VA Form 20- 0995, labeled as Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim. For more information about how to file a claim, please visit our website at [https://www.va.gov/disability/how-to-file-claim/](https://www.va.gov/disability/how-to-file-claim/)\n\n# 13\\. Q: What happens if the Veteran dies before his or her claim is decided?\n\nA: If the claimant dies while his or her claim is pending, a living dependent, such as a spouse or children, may file a request to be substituted as the claimant. Family with questions about benefits or filing a claim can visit the VA Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) website at [https://www.va.gov/burials-memorials/dependency-indemnity-compensation/](https://www.va.gov/burials-memorials/dependency-indemnity-compensation/).\n\n14. Q: If a Blue Water Navy Veteran has not applied for benefits in the past, but would like to apply now will the new presumption of exposure be extended to them?\n\nA: Yes, VA will apply the provisions of the law to Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans who file new claims based on exposure to herbicide agents such as Agent Orange.",

    "content": "15. Q: May the surviving spouse of a Blue Water Navy Veteran who passed away from a condition related to herbicide exposure, such as Agent Orange, and who was previously denied compensation for such condition, become entitled to Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC)?\n\nA: If the Veteran served on a Navy or Coast Guard vessel that is determined to have operated offshore of Vietnam as defined in the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act of 2019 and the cause of death was from a condition related exposure to an herbicide, such as Agent Orange, then VA may award DIC benefits on that basis. For more information: [https://www.va.gov/burialsmemorials/dependency-indemnity-compensation/](https://www.va.gov/burialsmemorials/dependency-indemnity-compensation/)\n\n# 16\\. Q: How will you contact Veterans who were previously denied for Agent Orange?\n\nA: Letters will be sent to the Blue Water Navy Veterans and survivors who were previously denied benefits. Veterans Service Organizations will be informed of changes in the law.\n\n# 17\\. Q: What benefits can a Veteran expect if their claim is approved?\n\nA: A Veteran may receive a monthly disability compensation payment and free VA healthcare related to their service-connected disability. The amount of compensation is determined by the diagnosed condition and level of disability.\n\n# 18\\. Q: Where can I get additional information on disability compensation for herbicide exposure such as Agent Orange?\n\nA: Veterans with questions about benefits or filing a claim can visit the VA Agent Orange website [https://www.va.gov/disability/eligibility/hazardous-materials-exposure/agent-orange/](https://www.va.gov/disability/eligibility/hazardous-materials-exposure/agent-orange/) and Compensation for Surviving Spouse and Dependents (VA DIC) website [https://www.va.gov/burials-memorials/dependency-indemnity-compensation/](https://www.va.gov/burials-memorials/dependency-indemnity-compensation/). They can also call 1-800-749-8387.\n\n# 19\\. Q: Is award of the Vietnam Service Medal enough to qualify for Agent Orange related disability compensation?\n\nA: No. Receipt of the Vietnam Service Medal as well as other decorations, does not automatically place a Veteran’s service within the offshore waters of the Republic of Vietnam. VA must be able to verify, through documentation, that the Veteran served within the Republic of Vietnam, to include the offshore waters as detailed in Public Law 116-23. The Vietnam Service Medal was given broadly to Service members in support roles, including those who did not serve in the Republic of Vietnam.\n\n# 20\\. Q: Are Blue Water Navy Veterans eligible for the Agent Orange Registry?\n\nA. Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans who state that they meet the criteria of Public Law 116- 23 are eligible for the Agent Orange Registry health exam. This health exam is a free VA service that alerts Veterans to possible long-term health problems that may be related to herbicide exposure to include toxins such as Agent Orange during military service. Being in the Agent Orange Registry does not verify eligibility for benefits. For more information, visit [https://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/agentorange/benefits/registry-exam.asp](https://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/agentorange/benefits/registry-exam.asp).\n\n# 21\\. Q: What changes were made to the Agent Orange presumption for Veterans who served in Korea?\n\nA: The Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act of 2019 changes the presumption dates for those who served in or near the Korean Demilitarized Zone from April 1, 1968 – August 31, 1971 to September 1, 1967 to August 31, 1971.\n\n22. Q: What changes were made in the law for children with spina bifida, whose parent served in Thailand from January 9, 1962 to May 7, 1975?\n\nA: A child with spina bifida whose Veteran parent is determined by VA to have been exposed to an herbicide agent while serving in Thailand between January 9, 1962, and May 7, 1975, can receive healthcare, vocational training and rehabilitation, and a monetary allowance. This makes the benefits coverage the same as for children of Vietnam and Korean service Veterans who were exposed to an herbicide such as Agent Orange. The child must be biological and conceived after the Veteran’s covered service in Thailand.",

    "content": "23. Q: I received a letter from VA saying I might be eligible; do I still need to file a claim?\n\nA: Veterans and survivors, who received a notification letter from VA, must still file a new claim. They should provide any new and relevant information regarding the claim such as dates their vessel traveled within the offshore waters of the Republic of Vietnam and updated medical information. A claim will automatically be reviewed under the new policy if it is currently in the VA review process or under appeal.\n\n24. Q. I am not sure where the vessel I was on traveled, is there some way I can determine if I am considered a Blue Water Navy Veteran?\n\nA: VA has established a special team specifically designated to research military and service treatment records and to determine whether a Veteran served in the eligible offshore waters of the Republic of Vietnam. To help us make that determination, VA encourages claimants to file a claim and submit any information of service in the Republic of Vietnam for any length of time between January 9, 1962, and May 7, 1975, aboard a U.S. military vessel that operated less than 12 nautical miles from the demarcation line of the waters of Vietnam and Cambodia. The specific area is defined in the Blue Water Navy Act of 2019. More information about Blue Water Navy Veterans can be found at [https://www.va.gov/disability/eligibility/hazardousmaterials-exposure/agent-orange/navy-coast-guard-ships-vietnam/](https://www.va.gov/disability/eligibility/hazardousmaterials-exposure/agent-orange/navy-coast-guard-ships-vietnam/).\n\n# 25\\. Q. If I was originally denied a claim under BWN, will I receive a retroactive payment?\n\nA. Presumptive conditions granted for Blue Water Navy Veterans may be retroactive to the date VA received your original claim. If you had a previously denied claim, for a presumptive condition and you resubmit your claim, the effective date will be determined on a case-by-case basis.\n\n26. Q: If I was on a vessel after the war in the Republic of Vietnam, does the Blue Water Navy Law apply to me if I have one of the presumptive conditions?\n\nA: To be eligible for presumption of service connection based on herbicide exposure, the Veteran must have been aboard a U.S. military vessel offshore of the Republic of Vietnam between January 9, 1962, and May 7, 1975, operating within 12-nautical miles seaward of a line commencing on the southwestern demarcation of the waters of Vietnam and Cambodia. For\n\n# 27\\. Q: The Blue Water Navy Act included changes to the VA Home Loan program. What are those changes?\n\nA: The law includes changes to the VA Home Loan program, most notably, changes to guaranteed loan limit amounts and to Congressionally-mandated home loan funding (user) fees. More specifically the law authorized:\n\nHome loan provisions take effect on January 1, 2020. On January 1, 2020, VA-guaranteed home loans will no longer be limited to the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) Conforming Loan Limits. Veterans will be able to obtain no-down payment home loans in all areas, regardless of loan amount.\n\n• On January 1, 2020, there will be temporary increases to the Congressionally-mandated VA Home Loan funding fee for some purchase and cash-out refinance loans. There will be a reduction in the home loan funding fee for Reservists and National Guard borrowers to align with the fee paid by ‘regular military’ borrowers. The law exempts Purple Heart recipients currently serving on active duty from the VA Home Loan funding fee. The law also removes the previous loan limit for Native American Veterans seeking to build or buy a home on Federal Trust land. The law also enables the Secretary to authorize VA appraisers to use their apprentices, trainees, or the information gathered by another subordinate appraiser to complete an appraisal for a VA guaranteed loan.\n\n# 28\\. Q: I’m a Veteran looking to use my VA home loan benefits. Does the removal of the VA loan limit mean I automatically qualify for a higher-priced house?\n\nA. No. Veteran borrowers seeking to use their VA home loan guaranty benefit still must qualify for a loan, based on credit and income requirements set forth by VA. Lenders will still look at your credit history, income, and other factors to assess your ability to afford payments on the mortgage. Some lenders may have additional lending criteria in place which exceed VA’s guidelines. VA recommends shopping amongst several lenders to compare interest rates, fees, and charges, before deciding which one can best meet your overall financial needs and goals.

Duties of the RO Research Coordinator |  | The RO Research Coordinator is the primary point of contact within each RO for all procedures related to requests for corroboration of stressors unrelated to MST or personal trauma.    <br>The RO Research Coordinator or individual acting in the capacity of an RO Research Coordinator<br>- submits all of the RO’s requests for stressor corroboration<br>  <br>- notifies RAR when further action on a pending research request is no longer necessary, such as when evidence is received that verifies the claimed stressor or the claim is withdrawn altogether, and<br>  <br>- forwards inquiries from the RO to the Office of Field Operations VBA RAR mailbox at [VAVBAWAS/CO/OFO/RAR](mailto:RRC.VBACO@va.gov).<br>  <br>**_Note_**:  The Veterans Service Center Manager, Decision Review Operations Center Manager, or designee must notify the RAR of any changes to the employee(s) in the RO Research Coordinator role by sending an e-mail to [VAVBAWAS/CO/OFO/RAR](mailto:RRC.VBACO@va.gov).  This includes instances in which an employee is <br>- no longer serving as an RO Research Coordinator, or <br>- newly assigned the role. |\n\n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ### VIII.iv.1.A.4.b.Criteria for Submission to RAR |  | The following general criteria must be met before the RO Research Coordinator may submit a request for corroboration of a claimed stressor to RAR:<br>- the required development is completed, but the claimed stressor cannot be conceded based on the stressor verification review procedures in [M21-1, Part VIII, Subpart iv, 1.A.3.d](https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018/content/554400000177468/M21-1-Part-VIII-Subpart-iv-Chapter-1-Section-A-General-Information-and-Development-for-Posttraumatic-Stress-Disorder-PTSD-Claims#3d), and  <br>  <br>- the claims folder contains the minimum information needed to allow additional research as described in [M21-1, Part VIII, Subpart iv, 1.A.3.o](https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018/content/554400000177468/M21-1-Part-VIII-Subpart-iv-Chapter-1-Section-A-General-Information-and-Development-for-Posttraumatic-Stress-Disorder-PTSD-Claims#3o).<br>  <br>**_Important_**: <br>- Do _not_ schedule a VA examination before receiving corroboration of the claimed in-service stressor. <br>  <br>- A diagnosis of PTSD is not a prerequisite for initiating the stressor verification process.<br>  <br>- While historically, the U.S. Army and Joint Services Records Research Center did not conduct research of all branches, RAR conducts research of stressors for all military branches.  <br>  <br>- Only RO Research Coordinators are authorized to submit stressor research requests to RAR. |",

    "content": "## **Bilateral Factor**\n\nJust when you thought VA math couldn't get more complicated!\n\nIf a Veteran has a rated condition (more than 0%) that affects **BOTH** the left and right sides of the **SAME** extremity half. Either upper (above the waist) or lower extremity (below the waist) then a bilateral factor is added to the VA math.\n\nIn short the bilateral conditions are given the VA math treatment and then an additional 10% is added. That number is then added back into consideration with the rest of the ratings.\n\n### Bilateral Case Examples\n\n\nIn the above image, you see the upper extremity half shown in a lighter shade and the lower extremity half shown in a darker shade of color.\n\n| Example Ratings | Supporting Image | Factor (Yes/No) | Explanation |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 10% each for the following disabilities: Left knee, right shoulder, and tinnitus. | ![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/66c515a3e8305f0f79e8b680/9d51af93-0e7c-47a4-836f-6d09bdf338ae/bi1.png) | No | Their are no disabilities that affect **BOTH** the left and right sides of the same extremity half. |\n| 0% right ankle and 10% each for the following disabilities: Left knee, left ankle. | ![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/66c515a3e8305f0f79e8b680/d801c0ce-75a7-44cb-b7dd-d7e844cae28c/bi2.png) | No | While there are disabilities that affect both the left and right sides of the same extremity half, they **BOTH** need to be to a compensational degree (at least 10%). |\n| 10% each for the following disabilities: Left knee, right ankle, right hip, and right elbow. | ![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/66c515a3e8305f0f79e8b680/b42378c7-0fd8-4d13-8e75-666497ad472a/bi3.png) | Yes/No | The factor is applied to the left knee, right ankle ratings, as well as the right hip. As the right hip falls under the lower extremity. However, the right elbow would **NOT** get the factor as the upper extremity is **NOT** affected on the left side. If it was, then they would get the factor as well. |\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTES:**\n\n- The Veteran does **NOT** need the same mirrored disability on both sides in order for the bilateral factor to apply! VA disability ratings look at whether an upper extremity (such as the shoulder, arm, or hand), or a lower extremity (such as the hip, knee, or foot) are affected by disabilities that affect both sides.\n\n- Effective April 16, 2023, in the rare circumstances in which the bilateral factor results in the combined disability evaluation being rounded down such as from 95 to 94%. The VA will _automatically_ disable the factor of a condition, so the end result is that the combined evaluation will be 100%!\n\n  - Veterans who were impacted by this change _should_ have been automatically reviewed and if appropriate been awarded [Dependents Educational Assistance (DEA)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/survivorbenefits#dea).\n\n### Applying the Factor\n\nThe bilateral factor will be applied to such bilateral disabilities before other combinations are carried out and the rating for such disabilities including the bilateral factor in this section will be treated as one disability for the purpose of arranging in order of severity and for all further combinations.\n\nFor example, with disabilities evaluated at 60%, 20%, 10% and 10% (the two 10's representing bilateral disabilities), the order of severity would be 60, 21 and 20. The 60 and 21 combine to 68 and the 68 and 20 to give you 74, rounding down to 70% as the final degree of disability.\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTES:**\n\n- [Painful/unstable scars](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/skin#7804) are **NOT** eligible for bilateral consideration.\n\n- [Deep](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/skin#7801) and [Superficial scars](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/skin#7802) **ARE** eligible for bilateral consideration so long as the ratings are **NOT**:\n\n  - Based on whole-body involvement; or\n\n  - Specific to the [Head, face, and/or neck](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/skin#7800).\n- [Hearing](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/ears) and [Eye](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/eyes) disabilities are **NOT** eligible for bilateral consideration.\n\n- [Cranial nerve](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/cranialnerves) conditions are **NOT** eligible for bilateral consideration.\n\n- [Fingers](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/hands) **ARE** eligible for bilateral consideration.\n\n- [Blood flow](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/bloodtubes) conditions involving extremities (such as varicose veins) **ARE** eligible for bilateral consideration.\n\n- [Feet](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/foot) disabilities that have \"bilateral\" in the name and bilateral [Shin splints](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/kneeleg#5262) do **NOT** automatically qualify for the bilateral factor ( **IF** they are the only bilateral eligible condition of that extremity!). **HOWEVER**, if there is another separate disability eligible for bilateral factor that affects the lower extremity - the other disability **AND** the bilateral named condition **WILL** _both_ get the bilateral factor!\n\n  - Bilateral pes planus rated at least 10% alone would **NOT** get the factor.\n\n  - Bilateral pes planus and a right ankle condition both rated at least 10% would **BOTH** get the factor.\n- To tell which conditions have an active bilateral factor, you would need to look at your codesheet.\n\n  - Click [Here](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/cfile) to learn how to request your codesheet.",

Generally speaking, unexpected money is back pay from a positive outcome on a claim or an audit found that you were underpaid - such as never being paid your book stipend or it being paid incorrectly.",

How can I get this fixed?\n\n**Answer:** First things first: The month of your effective date is **NOT** paid out (FOR VA DISABILITY) and VA always pays in arrears (end of the month), so if your pay is off by 1-2 months it is likely because of these factors.\n\n  - If you have accounted for these things and the math is _not_ mathing, you can call the VA at 1-800-827-1000 and ask that they do an audit.",

Phone: 1-800-827-0648 (or 1-612-713-6415 from overseas). Monday through Friday, 7:30 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. ET. If you have hearing loss, call TTY: 711.\n\n2.

Contact the VA via one of the above options;\n\n2. Complete and submit a [VA Form 5655](http://www.va.gov/vaforms/va/pdf/VA5655.pdf); and\n\n3.
