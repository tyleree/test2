Permanent and Total (P&T) is a special status that denotes a Veteran as being paid at the 100% rate (total) as well as their disabilities being considered static (permanent).

When you look at your decision letter itself, it will **NOT** state you were awarded permanent and total. Your decision letter will instead state that you have been granted entitlement to [Dependents Educational Assistance (DEA)](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/survivorbenefits#dea).

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- Permanent **IS** a misnomer! It does **NOT** mean that you cannot be reduced! The only time the VA **CANNOT** reduce an evaluation, is if you have held an evaluation for at least 20 years (barring instances of fraud)!


P&T veterans do **NOT** have regularly scheduled reexaminations. **UNLESS**, a non-static condition makes/or could make the veteran entitled to [Special Monthly Compensation (SMC)](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/smc). In which case, only the non-static condition is reexamined til such time as it becomes considered considered permanent 'static'.

* * *

## **Statutory P&T**

Veterans with the following service connected disabilities are considered P&T automatically:

- Loss of the use of both feet;

- Loss of both hands;

- Loss of both eyes;

- Loss of one foot and one hand;

- Loss of one foot and one eye;

- Loss of one hand and one eye;

- Loss of hearing of both ears;

- Organic loss of speech; or

- Permanently helpless or permanently bedridden.


Veterans with these disabilities are also entitled to SMC.

[Active pulmonary tuberculosis](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/airsystem#tb) will be considered permanently and totally disabling for [Non-service-connected pension](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/pension) purposes if _1_ of the following circumstances is meet:

- Associated with active tuberculosis involving other than the respiratory system;

- With severe associated symptoms or with extensive cavity formation; and/or

- Reactivated cases, generally;

  - With advancement of lesions on successive examinations or while under treatment.

  - Without retrogression of lesions or other evidence of material improvement at the end of 6 months hospitalization or without change of diagnosis from “active” at the end of 12 months hospitalization. Material improvement means lessening or absence of clinical symptoms, and X-ray findings of a stationary or retrogressive lesion.

## **Becoming P&T (outside of statutory P&T)**

As previously mentioned, P&T has two parts:

1. Total (you are paid at the 100% rate); and

2. Permanent 'static' (the condition(s) that make up the total are unlikely to improve).


Which means outside of statutory P&T you need:

- Static disabilities that [Combine](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vamath) to 100% scheduler;

- Have a singular static 100% evaluation; or

- The disabilit(ies) that were used as the basis of a Veteran becoming [TDIU](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/tdiu) are static.


* * *

### Permanent 'Static'

VBA's _current_ [Policy](https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018/content/554400000183159/Policy-Letter-21-01) boils down to:

- Raters are to make everything static **UNLESS**:

  - The rating schedule states a condition **MUST** be reevaluated; or

  - There is some other statutory requirement that a condition be reevaluated.

That said, in **_VERY RARE_** circumstances, the rater **CAN** deviate from this policy if there is **VERY** strong and convincing evidence that the condition is likely to improve in the future.

However, if the Veteran is at least 55 years old _or_ the condition is rated at the minimum compensational (at least 10%) evaluation - the rater **CANNOT** make the condition not static, **UNLESS** there is a statutory or [Rating schedule](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/ratingsindex) requirement that the condition be reevaluated.

- For more information click [HERE](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mandatory).


But know in **MOST** cases, if you are now rated 100% combined that you will be made P&T.

* * *

#### Common Examples of Non-Static Conditions:

These are some examples of conditions that have mandatory reevaluations and _generally_ cannot be made static in an initial grant.

- Cancers\*

- [Diabetes insipidus](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/endsystem#7909) (if rated within 3 months of the initial diagnosis)

- [Mental health](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/mental) condition due to traumatic stress and is the basis of a [Medboard](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/medboard) (condition **MUST** be reevaluated after 6 months of separation)

- [Stroke](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/cns#8008) (if rated within 6 months of the stroke)

- Thyroid conditions (if rated shortly after initial diagnosis)


_If your doctor thinks your cancer is \*at least as likely as not, unlikely_ to go into remission before the end or your life and/or cancer treatment is _at least as likely as not_ going to continue for the rest of your life. You may submit their statement to the VA requesting the condition become considered static with a [Claim](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vaclaim) for increase.

## **Additional Benefits**

Veterans who are P&T are entitled to many additional benefits that other 100% Veterans are not. Here are some examples:

## **Mostly HISTORICAL EXAMPLE**

The following example is for the most-part historical since as previously stated, _most_ conditions will now be made static out the gate. However, Veterans who were rated **BEFORE** October 2021 were more likely to have conditions found to be non-static due to raters getting more freedom to consider conditions non-static.

* * *

### VA Math Example of Becoming P&T

Having more disabilities that combine over 100% scheduler does **NOT** necessarily increase the likelihood that the Veteran will become P&T! This is particularly true if those new disabilities/increases are not considered static.

| Jane's Ratings | Static | [Combined Ratings Table](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&rgn=div5&view=text&node=38:1.0.1.1.5&idno=38#se38.1.4_125) | Jane's Combined Total Rating (Starts at 0%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mental Health = 70% | No |  | 70% |
| Bi-Lateral Plantar Fasciitis = 50% | Yes | Row:70%, Col:50% | 85% |
| Back = 40% | Yes | Row:85%, Col:40% | 91% |
| Migraines = 30% | No | Row:91%, Col:30% | 94% |
| IBS = 30% | No | Row:94%, Col:30% | 97% |
| Right Shoulder = 20% | Yes | Row:97%, Col:20% | 99% |
| Tinnitus = 10% | Yes | Row:99%, Col:10% | 99% |
| Neck = 10% | Yes | Row:99%, Col:10% | 99% |

Jane's Combined Rating rounds up to 100%.

**P&T?**: NO, because their combined static disabilities does not round up to 100%.

* * *

### Static Math Breakdown

| Jane's Ratings | Static | [Combined Ratings Table](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&rgn=div5&view=text&node=38:1.0.1.1.5&idno=38#se38.1.4_125) | Jane's Combined Total Rating (Starts at 0%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bi-Lateral Plantar Fasciitis = 50% | Yes |  | 50% |
| Back = 40% | Yes | Row:50%, Col:40% | 70% |
| Right Shoulder = 20% | Yes | Row:70%, Col:20% | 76% |
| Tinnitus = 10% | Yes | Row:76%, Col:10% | 78% |
| Neck = 10% | Yes | Row:78%, Col:10% | 80% |

Jane's Static Combined Rating is 80%.

Again, if Jane wanted to become P&T, she would need to have enough static disabilities that combined to 100% scheduler to become P&T.

## **Frequently** **Asked Questions**

- #### How do I know which conditions of mine are static?






- Click [HERE](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/static-check) for details on how to check online.


- #### I was just rated 100% combined/TDIU and all of my conditions that make up the 100%/TDIU are static but I wasn't made P&T? What do I do?






- While uncommon, sometimes raters overlook a grant of P&T. Whenever you are 100% combined and your conditions _are_ static, but P&T was **NOT** awarded, the VA will _automatically_ establish an audit (usually within 2 weeks of the rating decision). These audits are conducted by a human who will then give you a grant of P&T, assuming there are no other issues at play.

- If no audit was ever started, you can:

  - Make a [VERA appointment](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vera) and ask if they could have their coach (supervisor) make an EP930 to control for the missed issue of entitlement to depent’s educational assistance;

  - If within a year of **ANY** rating decision; filing a [Higher Level Review (HLR)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals) and cite “Missed issue of dependents’ educational assistance; **_OR_**

  - [File a claim](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vaclaim) for “Entitlement to Dependent’s Educational Assistance, due to being permanent and total”.

  - A rater will review your file and grant if appropriate.

- #### Can I be P&T if I am rated under 100%?






- Yes, see the [TDIU page](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/tdiu) for more information.


- #### Can I request P&T status? I am 100%/TDIU due to non-static condition(s).






- Yes:

  - If your non-static condition is a type of _active_ cancer:

    - Veterans can file a claim for increase of the cancer **_WITH_** a doctor's letter explaining why your cancer is not likely to improve and how the cancer and/or treatment is likely to continue till your death.
  - If your non-static condition is not subject to a mandatory reevaluation\*:

    - [File a claim](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vaclaim) for “Entitlement to [Dependent’s Educational Assistance, due](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/survivorbenefits#dea) to being permanent and total (DEA)”, and state what condition(s) of yours would make you P&T if they were all static.

    - If within a year of the last rating decision file a [Higher Level Review](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals) and state your condition(s) should be static and that you should have been awarded DEA.
- No:

  - Your non-static condition is a non-cancer condition with a mandatory reevaluation\*.

\*For a list of conditions that have mandatory reevaluations click [HERE](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mandatory).

- #### How do I request my C-File/Code Sheet?






- Click [HERE](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/cfile) to learn how.


- #### Is my P&T status protected?






- No, a Veteran's ratings are only truly [Protected](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/ratingsindex#protection) once they have held that rating for 20 years. After 20 years the only way a rating can be changed is in case of fraud. In this case, the ratings will be removed whenever the fraud is discovered.


- #### I'm being told I have a reevaluation, what do I do?






- Unless you filed a new claim, you should _not_ have a [Reevaluation](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/cnp) and this could be an error. However, since the VA does do audits which may identify potential issues with a previous rating decision. It is **STRONGLY** advised to **NOT MISS** the C&P exam, as missing the exam may result in you losing your P&T status and your evaluation(s) being [Proposed](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/reduction) to be reduced/severed!

- Additionally, **EVEN IF** have a condition which is non-static due to it having [Mandatory](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mandatory) reevaluations and the condition itself does **NOT** give you _any_ benefits you will still be expected to attend the reevaluation (if asked). Otherwise the condition may be reduced as appropriate.

  - Why though?

    - It is more-so on the off chance in the future the condition may play into [Special Monthly Compensation](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/smc).

- #### If I am TDIU P&T am I no longer restricted by income limits?






- No, Veterans who are P&T simply no longer have regularly scheduled reexaminations. The Veteran still is bound by TDIU income limits.


- #### What is organic loss of speech?






- Organic loss of speech means the loss of the ability to express oneself, both by voice and whisper, through the normal organs of speech if such loss is caused by organic changes in such organs. Where such loss exists, the fact that some speech can be produced through the use of an artificial appliance or other organs of the body will be disregarded.


- #### If I get surgery at the VA can I lose my P&T status?






- Not purely because you had the surgery.

  - Generally the VA does not care if you have had a surgery. For more information click [HERE](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/xtalk).

- #### Can I work if I am P&T?






- Yes, the only P&T Veterans who have work restrictions are those who were awarded [TDIU](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/tdiu).


- #### How can I check if I am P&T?






- On [va.gov](http://va.gov/) via the [VA Benefit Summary letter](https://www.va.gov/records/download-va-letters/). Once logged in, click the green box “Get your VA benefit letters,” then “View letters,” then “VA Letters,” and finally “Benefit Summary and Service Verification Letter.” Scroll down and check the section that says, “You **are** considered to be totally and permanently disabled due solely to your service-connected disabilities.” If it say are you are, if it say aren't you aren't.


- #### I am P&T should I continue to make claims?






- Generally no. The exception to this is if the claimed condition is likely to lead to [Death](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/deathbenefits) or a [SMC](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/smc). But even then, be aware that by filing new claims you open the possibility of all your claims being reevaluated, which may result in you losing your P&T status.


- #### Can I be P&T if I have non-static conditions?






- Sure thing! So long as the conditions that make up the 100% evaluation or TDIU grant are static.

  - A common example would be you are 100% combined (static) for various conditions and have a grant of active cancer. The cancer while non-static does not go into the calculation of the 100%, so you can be P&T just fine.

- #### Wait? Why the hell wouldn't the VA make cancer static if the cancer does not give any benefits? Seems extra silly to waste everyone's time with reevaluations?






- There are a few thoughts here:

  - The 100% evaluation from the cancer can make the Veteran eligible for Special Monthly Compensation (SMC).

  - If it does not give them SMC currently it could give them a higher level of SMC in the future.
