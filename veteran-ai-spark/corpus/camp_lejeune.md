## Am I eligible for VA disability compensation?

You may be eligible for disability compensation payments on a presumptive basis if you meet all of these requirements. These requirements apply to Veterans, Reservists, and National Guard members.

**Both of these descriptions must be true:**

- You served at Camp Lejeune or MCAS New River, North Carolina, for at least 30 days total between August 1, 1953, and December 31, 1987, **and**
- You didn’t receive a dishonorable discharge when you separated from the military

**And you must have a diagnosis of 1 or more of these presumptive conditions:**

- Adult leukemia
- Aplastic anemia and other myelodysplastic syndromes
- Bladder cancer
- Kidney cancer
- Liver cancer
- Multiple myeloma
- Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma
- Parkinson’s disease

Evidence shows a link between these conditions and exposure to chemicals found in the drinking water at Camp Lejeune and MCAS New River during this time.

## What does it mean to have a presumptive condition?

To get a VA disability rating, your disability must connect to your military service. For many health conditions, you need to prove that your service caused your condition.

But for some conditions, we automatically assume (or “presume”) that your service caused your condition. We call these presumptive conditions.

Presumptive conditions are established by law or regulation.

If you have a presumptive condition, you don’t need to prove that your service caused the condition. You only need to meet the service requirements for the presumption.

## How do I file a claim for disability compensation?

## How the PACT Act affects Camp Lejeune claims and related benefits

- Expand all
- Collapse all

### How does the PACT Act affect people who lived at Camp Lejeune?

Section 804 of the Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act addresses people who lived at Camp Lejeune. This law is also called the Camp Lejeune Justice Act of 2022.

This law allows Veterans, survivors, and families to file for appropriate relief for harm caused by exposure to the contaminated water at Camp Lejeune.

You (or your legal representative) can file for relief under this authority if either of these descriptions is true:

- You lived, worked, or were otherwise exposed at Camp Lejeune for at least 30 days total between August 1, 1953, and December 31, 1987, **or**
- Your mother lived, worked, or was otherwise exposed at Camp Lejeune for at least 30 days total between August 1, 1953, and December 31, 1987, while pregnant with you

**Note:** The PACT Act doesn’t affect VA benefits related to Camp Lejeune. The law does expand VA health care and benefits for Veterans exposed to burn pits and other toxic substances.

[Learn more about the PACT Act and your VA benefits](https://www.va.gov/resources/the-pact-act-and-your-va-benefits "The PACT Act and your VA benefits")

### How can I file for relief under the Camp Lejeune Justice Act?

You (or your legal representative) can start by filing an administrative claim with the Department of the Navy.

You can follow the Navy’s process to seek an award of relief for your claim. You may also be able to choose the Department of the Navy’s new elective option to get a faster settlement decision directly from the Navy. Or if the Navy denies your claim or you wait longer than 6 months for a decision, you can file a lawsuit in the Eastern District of North Carolina.

[Learn how to file for Camp Lejeune relief on the Navy's website](https://www.navy.mil/clja/)

### Will filing for relief affect my VA benefits or health care?

No. Filing for relief under the Camp Lejeune Justice Act of 2022 won’t affect your eligibility for VA disability or health care benefits.

If the court awards you relief under this law (or if a court awarded relief in the past), this won’t affect the amount of your VA disability payments or your eligibility for VA health care.  A settlement through the Department of the Navy’s elective option process also won’t affect your VA benefits or health care in any way.

### Will my VA benefits affect my award from a lawsuit?

Yes, in some cases. Your benefits may affect your award if both of these descriptions are true:

- A court awards you relief as a result of a lawsuit filed under the Camp Lejeune Justice Act of 2022, **and**

- You already get VA benefits or health care related to exposure to water at Camp Lejeune


The court must reduce (or “offset”) the award by the amount of any related disability award, payment, or benefit we provided to you or your legal representative from a lawsuit. If you choose the elective option claim process, this offset doesn’t apply to you.

VA benefits that aren’t related to exposure to contaminated water at Camp Lejeune won’t affect your award from a lawsuit.

### How can I check the status of my lawsuit under the Camp Lejeune Justice Act of 2022?

You can contact the Department of Justice by phone or email:

- Call [202-353-4426](tel:+12023534426) ( [TTY: 711](tel:711)), **or**
- Send an email to [camplejeune.pactact@usdoj.gov](mailto:camplejeune.pactact@usdoj.gov)
