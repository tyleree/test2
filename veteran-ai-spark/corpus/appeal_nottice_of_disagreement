# **Filing an Appeal**

If you do **NOT** agree with your claim's decision, you may file an appeal. Just like [Filing a claim](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vaclaim) you _may_ use the assistance of a [VSO](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vso), lawyer, or an accredited claims agent.

There are three initial different methods to appeal:

1. Higher-Level Review;

2. Supplemental claim; or

3. Board of Veteran Appeals (BVA).


If your appeal is denied again you **CAN** try another eligible option (see applicable notes).

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- If you want to keep your [Effective date](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/edate) (your back pay) you **MUST** file an appeal within **one year** of your claim's decision date! Veterans who fail to do that can only get their original effective date and back pay if there is a [Clear and Unmistakable Error (CUE)](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals#cue).

- Lawyers and claims agents **CANNOT** charge more than **33.3%**\\* (excluding expenses\*\*) of the Veteran's back pay. Further, they can _only_ get paid if/when the Veteran wins their appeal. Again, VSOs are a resource that is free to the Veteran.

- **PICK A LANE**! You **CANNOT** file multiple appeals/methods for the _same issue_ at the same time ( _without_ first withdrawing the current appeal)!

  - If you filed an appeal to BVA and are tired of waiting you **CANNOT** then file a supplemental claim while the BVA case is pending for the _same issues_.

  - Likewise, you **CANNOT** file an HLR and supplemental claim for the same issue at the same time, etc.

  - You **CAN** file an HLR for [Hearing loss](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/ears) and a supplemental claim for a [Back](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/spine) issue at the same time - since they are _different issues_.

  - **EXCEPTION:**

    - If you have an appeal in at a court above BVA you **_CAN_** then have a separate appeal open for the same issue (just can’t go immediately back to the previous lower court).

\*The VA will only pay up to 20% automatically from the back pay. If the agreement is over 20% then, the Veteran will need to pay the difference to the lawyer themselves.

\*\*Expenses can be things like postage, travel costs, or printing supplies.

## **BEFORE You File an Appeal**

**_BEFORE_** you appeal your claim do so in an informed manner! Don't run back onto the battlefield without a plan!

Read your **Decision Letter**!

- Was _all_ the evidence you submitted listed under evidence considered?

- What were the favorable findings?

- What does it say your claim was missing?

- Did it say you missed an exam?


Your decision letter _should_ outline what you need to do in order to make a successful appeal!

- For information on understanding rating decisions click [HERE](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/ratingdecision).


* * *

### Getting a Copy of Your Decision Narrative

You can get a copy of your decision online [HERE](https://www.va.gov/track-claims/your-claim-letters)\*.

_Alternatively, after_ 10 days have past since the claim closed, you can call the VA at 1-800-827-1000 and request them email your decision narrative to you.

\*This **CAN** be used to get old decision letters as well.

* * *

### Getting a Copy of Your C-file/Examiner's Report/Codesheet

- Click [HERE](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/cfile) to learn how to get your C-file/Examiner's reports.


[Return to top](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals#top)

## **Denied Service-Connection**

If you were not granted [Service-connection](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/serviceconnection), what was missing from your claim?

- Was it a current diagnosis;

- An in service event; and/or

- Did the examiner say that there was _a less likely than not_ chance that your disability was the result of your service or service-connected disability?


If you feel that the rater did not properly evaluate the evidence that was a part of your claim, an HLR may be appropriate.

Otherwise if you need to submit additional supporting information, a supplemental claim may be appropriate. Veterans who need help with the determination of service-connection may want to look into submitting an [Independent medical opinion (IMO)/Nexus letter](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/imo), [Personal statement](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/personal), or [Buddy statement(s)](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/buddy), as appropriate.

If you were told you missed an exam then file a supplemental claim and state, "I am willing an able to attend exams at this time" on the appeal form.

[Return to top](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals#top)

## **Low Rating**

If you were granted service-connection (at least 0% evaluation) but were given an evaluation that was lower than what you expected, you can appeal this. Your decision letter _should_ detail what the criteria is for the next highest evaluation. It should also note if the rating you were awarded was the maximum. If it says you are the maximum... you should really leave it be...

If you feel that you meet the [Requirements](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/ratingSIndex) for a higher rating then you should verify the information in the Examiner's [Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ)](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/dbq). If the DBQ indicates you should have gotten a higher rating, an HLR may be appropriate. If the DBQ indicates otherwise then a supplemental claim (with medical evidence dated **BEFORE** the rater made their decision, would be more appropriate).

## **Priority Processing**

Certain factors can make a Veteran eligible for priority process.

[Return to top](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals#top)

## **Higher-Level Review** [**(HLR 20-0996)**](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-20-0996-ARE.pdf)

An entirely new review of your claim by an experienced (more senior) rater; formally these are titled Decision Review Officers (DRO).

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- New evidence (evidence received **AFTER** the decision was made) **CANNOT** be considered in a Higher-Level Review!

- [Intent to files](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vaclaim#itf) do **NOT** apply to HLRs!

- Unlike other raters DROs get the extra authority to issue a _differences of opinion_.

  - Differences of opinions include weighing evidence differently which result in a favorable outcome for the Veteran. These differences of opinions are **NOT** errors made by the last rater, just a _difference of opinion_.

  - Mere differences of opinions **CANNOT** result in a negative outcome for the Veteran!

    - However, if the previous rater(s) made [Clear and Unmistakable Errors (CUEs)](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals#cue) those errors **CAN** be corrected **EVEN** if negative (with appropriate [Due notice](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/proposed)).

NOTES:

- The Veteran **CANNOT** file a HLR, back-to-back. **HOWEVER**, you **CAN** file a HLR into a supplemental, into another HLR, into a supplemental, etc.

- The Veteran **CANNOT** request an HLR after having a BVA denial.

- The Veteran **MUST** submit their HLR within a year of their claim's decision. Veterans are **NOT** allowed to request an HLR after this time frame.


| Question | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Should I choose this? | If you think the evidence the VA has is enough to make a positive decision. |
| What will happen? | A senior rater will reexamine your claim. |

* * *

### Informal Conference

If you would like to plead your case to the person doing your appeal you may request an informal conference (Section IV of the form).

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- If the rater **CAN** make a **POSITIVE** decision based upon the evidence of record the rater **CAN** decide that an informal conference is unnecessary! So do not feel bad if one is **NOT** scheduled!

- You can **ONLY** talk about errors of fact _or_ law as it relates to your appeal during this call.

  - This would include things such as, the VA missing or not considering evidence that was originally submitted with your claim.

  - Ideally, you would have this planned out so you can point out specifically where evidence is: 'Evidence that I had an in-service event can be found on page x of my service treatment records'.
- Choosing to have an informal conference _may_ result in your appeal taking longer to process.


* * *

#### Alternative to Informal Conference

Instead of requesting an informal conference you may submit a [Personal statement](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/personal) with your HLR.

Again, you can **ONLY** write about errors of fact _or_ law as it relates to your appeal. Remember, you **CANNOT** use this statement as a means to add new evidence to your appeal!

* * *

### Submitting an HLR

There are several options to submit your HLR to the VA:

- Complete and Submit Online Form

  - Click [HERE](https://www.va.gov/decision-reviews/higher-level-review/request-higher-level-review-form-20-0996/start).
- Submit Paper Form Online

  - Click [HERE](https://eauth.va.gov/accessva/?cspSelectFor=quicksubmit).
- Via your VSO

- In-person

  - Click [HERE](https://www.va.gov/find-locations/) to locate your nearest Regional Office.
- Snail Mail


> ```
>  Department of Veterans Affairs
>  Claims Intake Center
>  PO Box 4444
>  Janesville, WI 53547-4444
> ```

**!!WARNING!!**

- The VA will **NOT** go by the postmark! The VA will go off the date the appeal is initially processed by the VA's intake center. As such, if your appeal is processed **AFTER** the one year deadline your appeal will be refused and you **WILL** lose your effective date (back pay)!


* * *

### Claim Accuracy Request (CAR) \[PILOT PROGRAM\]

```
May also be called claim accuracy review.
```

CAR is a quicker/priority lane version of an HLR, with the lofty goal of a decision within 30 days.

**ONLY** VSOs, accredited attorneys, and accredited agents may request a CAR for obvious errors of fact or law (Does _not_ have to be a [Clear and Unmistakable Error (CUE)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals#cue), but that is the general idea behind it).

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- This request **MUST** be made within **30 DAYS** of the date of the notification letter for the rating decision!

- If the CAR does _not_ find a error occurred, another HLR for the issue **CANNOT** be filed back-to-back! A supplemental or BVA appeal _can_ be filed.


* * *

### Flowchart of an HLR

By their design HLRs could be considered as starting in the Rating step of the [Stages of a claim](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/stages) \- as they are simply a review of the existing evidence and do not allow consideration of new or gathering new evidence. Which is likely why the VA doesn’t give insight into where an HLR is at… since it is either waiting on a DRO or is in short order waiting on authorization.

If a de facto supplemental claim is opened then it will follow the normal stages of a claim.

![Flowchart showing the process after receiving a valid HLR, with decision points for DTA error, difference of opinion, and new evidence needed, leading to rating decisions and claims outcomes.](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/66c515a3e8305f0f79e8b680/71f7c8fc-d8e9-4042-9745-4b1863110fa7/hlrflowchart.png)

* * *

### Deciding a HLR

If the senior rater is able to make an appropriate grant/denial based upon the existing evidence of record they will do so. However, if the senior rater finds a [Duty to Assist (DTA)](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/dta) error they will make a rating decision and close the HLR; noting the DTA errors they found that need to be addressed.

These DTA errors will be addressed in a de facto supplemental claim, which is opened (at some point).

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- The DRO **CAN** find a DTA error, confirm and continue, and issue a difference of opinion on separate issues all within the same decision.

- This supplemental claim will **NOT** use any new [Intents to File](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vaclaim#intent)!

  - If the VA is able to grant then any intent to file associated with the prior claim/appeals **CAN** be used to assign an [Effective date](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/edate#itf) \- just that the de facto supplemental will not itself use any unassociated intents hanging around in your file.
- This de facto supplemental claim **DOES** allow you to submit new and relevant evidence!

- This de facto supplemental claim _is_ decided by raters who are **NOT** DROs.

  - These raters are **NOT** given the extra authority or power that DROs get!
- If the de facto supplemental claim decision results in another denial you **CAN** file a HLR on the decision!


[Return to top](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals#top)

## **Supplemental Claim** [**(20-0995)**](http://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-20-0995-ARE.pdf)

An opportunity to submit **NEW AND RELEVANT** evidence.

- New: The VA did not previously have/consider it.

- Relevant: Directly addresses the rationale for the denial.

  - For example: If you were denied for having no diagnosis, you need to supply evidence of a diagnosis.

New and relevant evidence can take the form of:

- Being seen by your doctor for the claimed issue(s);

- New theory of service-connection (claiming your condition was caused by another service-connected disability);

  - This _does_ include [Presumptive conditions](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/Presumptive) be they old or recently passed presumptives;
- Exam willingness - if you were previously denied because you missed an exam, simply state that you are willing and able to attend new examinations;

- [Independent medical opinion (IMO)/Nexus letter](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/imo);

- [DBQ](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/dbq);

- [Personal statements](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/personal); or

- [Buddy statements](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/buddy).


**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- Remember you have **1 year** from the claim's decision to file an appeal (if you want to potentially keep your back pay). Which means 1 year to develop additional evidence for your claim. We recommend waiting until you have enough evidence to be successful before filing - your VSO or lawyer can advise you on this. Do not file appeals with insufficient evidence, this just gums up the system for you and other Veterans!

  - Do know you **CAN** extend this window for by filing an [Intent to file](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vaclaim#intent)! The intent to file will give you a year (from the intent to file) to gather evidence. While allowing you to keep back pay.
- If the VA grants an increased rating based upon a supplemental claim, the [Effective date](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/edate) does **NOT** automatically go back to the original claim!

  - If **MEDICAL** evidence shows an increase is warranted that is dated **BEFORE/AFTER** you initiated your supplemental claim the effective date will typically be the date of the medical evidence showing an increase was warranted; this typically is the date of your [Examination](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/cnp)!
- Do **NOT** file a supplemental claim for an evaluation after a year! Even if you have new evidence showing a higher evaluation was previously warranted! If you do, at best the effective date will be the date the supplemental was initiated or at **WORST** the date of the examination conducted **AFTER** your filed the supplemental! So in these cases, just file a increase claim!


NOTES:

- Veterans **CAN** file a supplemental claim **ANYTIME** after their denial. However, to _potentially_ get back pay from the start, they _must_ file within a year of the last decision.

- Veterans **CAN** submit a supplemental claim over and over again. _So long as_, there is new and relevant evidence being submitted _every time_.

- If you need the VA to get non-federal medical records or [Vet Center](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vetcenter) records for you, then you will need to also submit a [VA Form 21-4142/21-4142a](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/vba-21-4142-are.pdf).


| Question | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Should I choose this? | If your appeal requires new evidence. |
| What will happen? | A decision will be made looking at the new and previous evidence. |

* * *

### Submitting a Supplemental Claim

There are several options to submit your supplemental claim to the VA:

- Complete and Submit Online Form

  - Click [HERE](https://www.va.gov/decision-reviews/supplemental-claim/file-supplemental-claim-form-20-0995/start).
- Submit Paper Form Online

  - Click [HERE](https://eauth.va.gov/accessva/?cspSelectFor=quicksubmit).
- Via your VSO or lawyer

- In-person

  - Click [HERE](https://www.va.gov/find-locations/) to locate your nearest Regional Office.
- Snail Mail


> ```
>  Department of Veterans Affairs
>  Claims Intake Center
>  PO Box 4444
>  Janesville, WI 53547-4444
> ```

**!!WARNING!!**

- The VA will **NOT** go by the postmark! The VA will go off the date the appeal is initially processed by the VA's intake center. As such, if your appeal is processed **AFTER** the one year deadline your appeal will be refused and you **WILL** lose your effective date (back pay)!


* * *

### Supplemental Claim Status

Currently claim trackers will either show your claims status as:

- "We don't know your status"; or

- "A reviewer is examining your new evidence".


Either of these statuses will remain till the claim is actually closed out.

[Return to top](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals#top)

## **Board Veterans' Appeals (BVA) AKA, Notice of Disagreement (NOD), AKA** [**10182**](https://www.va.gov/vaforms/va/pdf/VA10182.pdf)

Review by a Veterans Law Judge at the Board of Veterans’ Appeals. These judges are **NOT** bound by VA Central Office policy decisions and **CAN** issue grants that raters are unable to do! So you will see decisions which are inconsistent or directly contradict VA policies being made by these judges.

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- Due to the time this takes to complete a BVA appeal ( **YEARS**) it is commonly only chosen once the other appeal options (Supplemental Claim and/or Higher Level Review) have been exhausted.

- The Veteran can **MUST** submit their appeal to the BVA within a year of their claim's decision. Veterans are **NOT** allowed to request a BVA after this time frame.

- Veterans are **NOT** allowed to request a BVA appeal _after_ receiving a BVA decision _for the same claimed item - back to back_.


There are three lanes (appeal dockets) in which the Veteran can choose when going through the BVA:

1. Direct Review

2. Evidence Submission

3. Hearing


* * *

### 1\. Direct Review

In essence an HLR. However, instead of a senior rater a judge reviews your claim. Due to there be far fewer judges than senior raters, this **WILL** take much longer than an HLR.

NOTE:

- You **CANNOT** submit new evidence.


* * *

### 2\. Evidence Submission

In essence a supplemental claim. However instead of a rater a judge reviews your claim. Due to there be far fewer judges than raters, this **WILL** take much longer than an supplemental claim.

NOTE:

- You **CAN** submit new evidence. If you do not submit all the evidence with your claim you have **90 days** from the day your NOD is received.


* * *

### 3\. Hearing

Your chance to plead your case before a judge by videoconference (or in-person in DC). After your hearing you will have 90 days to submit any new evidence. The Judge will make a decision considering the hearing and the evidence of record.

* * *

### Submitting to BVA

There are several options to submit your appeal to the BVA:

- Online

  - Click [HERE](https://www.va.gov/decision-reviews/board-appeal/request-board-appeal-form-10182/introduction).
- Via your VSO or lawyer

- Fax

## **Higher Courts (Courts above BVA)**

If you run out of new evidence and feel you just really need to take it to a higher judge then you can continue!

* * *

### Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC)

These judges can really do whatever they want in terms of interpreting the laws and regulations that bind the VBA. As such, decisions made by the CAVC create case law that _does_ change how the VBA operates!

Veterans have **120 days** after their BVA decision in which to have their appeal in the hands of the CAVC. This appeal **MUST** be made to the [CAVC itself](https://www.uscourts.cavc.gov/appeal.php) and **NOT** the VA!

While the Veteran is allowed to represent themselves it is **STRONGLY** recommended that they seek out a lawyer at this stage!

* * *

### [Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC)](http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/)

Veterans **MUST** submit a Notice of Appeal (NOA) to the CAFC through the CAVC, within **60 days** after the judgment is issued.

* * *

### U.S. Supreme Court

The last and highest court you can go to is the U.S. Supreme Court.

## **Researching Previous Cases**

The BVA decision [Search engine](https://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=bvadecisions) is your best friend to see how other cases similar to yours have been decided. Plug in keywords for your claim/appeal and search away!

- Click [HERE](http://www.uscourts.cavc.gov/orders_and_opinions.php) to see past cases decided by the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC).


**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- BVA does **NOT** establish case law! But the decisions _can_ help you if you try and use the arguments they presented.


[Return to top](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals#top)

## **Accredited Agents and Attorneys**

For Veterans who have a claim that has a certain legal angle or issue(s). Obtaining the services of an accredited agent or attorney may be beneficial.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- _Most_ appeals do **NOT** require legal assistance!


In order for an accredited agent or attorney to represent the Veteran. Both parties must sign a [VA Form 21-22a](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/vba-21-22a-are.pdf).

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- Pay attention to **Block 23**! If you are only interested in having representation for a specific claim you **MUST** write this interest in this block! Failure to do so allows them to file additional appeals without additional consent!


* * *

### Fees (Fee Agreement)

By [Law](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/38/14.636) the Veteran **CANNOT** be charged more than **33.3%** of any _back pay_ the Veteran receives from the VA.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- If the Veteran feels their agent/attorney did not earn their fee. Due to perceptions of poor communication with the Veteran, lack of action, etc. The Veteran **CAN** file a motion to have the fee reduced **OR** removed.


For more information on the process click [HERE](https://www.va.gov/ogc/docs/accred/howtochallengeafee.pdf).

* * *

### Removing Representation

It is possible to remove an accredited agent or an attorney from representing you at **ANY** time. This can be done by:

- Submitting a [Personal statement](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/personal) saying you want to remove/revoke access to your specific representative;

- Calling the VA at 1-800-698-2411 and let them know “Please remove \[Name of representative\] as my representative immediately.”; _or_

- Assigning someone new as your representative be it another attorney, claim agent, or [VSO](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vso).


**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- Removing their representation does **NOT VOID** the fee agreement (you likely signed)! If it did there would be a lot of slick Veterans trying to screw over their representative.

  - Again, if you later win your appeal and you feel they did not earn their fee you **CAN** still fight it (as mentioned previously).

[Return to top](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals#top)

## **Clear and Unmistakable Error (CUE)**

Oh no, it has been over a year but I still want all my back pay! If your claim has a CUE it is possible to still get that back pay.

CUEs are **EXTREMELY** fact specific as such it is **STRONGLY** advised that the Veteran seek out an experienced VSO or lawyer to help them! If the Veteran makes an error in their filing the VA does **NOT** have a duty to assist them in the cases of CUEs. As such the CUE may be wasted.

CUEs are **NOT** a matter of a difference in opinion. CUEs involve errors that **CANNOT** be debated and must be such, that a _reasonable person_ would agree that the VA messed up.

CUEs must be based upon evidence that was available to the VA at the time the decision was made. The Veteran **CANNOT** assert that later evidence or evidence that was not given to the VA proved that the Veteran should have been given a favorable decision!

Further, CUEs **MUST** be considered in the realm of what the laws/regulations/policies were _at the time they were decided_. Veterans **CANNOT** try to apply current laws/regulations/policies to decisions that were made prior to them!

In order to invoke a CUE the Veteran **MUST** state a CUE has occurred _AND_ **MUST** specify the factual or legal error(s) at issue.

**Seriously, get help!**

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- You only get **_ONE_** shot at a CUE per issue. That's it! If you pick something that isn't a CUE and you look back and 'gosh, oh shoot this other thing is the CUE!' That is it. Thanks for playing!

- [Duty to Assist](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/dta) errors can **NEVER** be the basis of a CUE; as only evidence of record at the time of the prior decision can be considered.

- CUEs are a knife that **CAN** cut both ways! Meaning these errors getting corrected **CAN** end up hurting or helping you. It is common for raters to find multiple additional CUEs when you declare a CUE; since a rater who already made at least 1 CUE is generally just gonna mess everything else up!

  - CUEs **CANNOT** sever service-connection for conditions that have been service-connected for at least 10 years (barring findings of the grant itself having no legal basis or fraud).

    - If [Secondary](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/claimtype#secondary) service-connection is granted for a condition **AND** the condition it is secondary to is severed, then the VA will then propose to sever the secondary conditions - assuming there are no other routes to grant them service-connection.
  - CUEs **CANNOT** reduce an evaluation held for at least 20 years.
- Forgotten claims (conditions not rated) and missed issues (conditions that should have been inferred or ancillary benefits that were overlooked) are **NOT** CUEs! While they are certainly administrative errors, they are _not_ CUEs because the VA has not erred in making a decision one way or the other.

  - Generally forgotten and missed issues/benefits **CAN** be granted **WITH** back dated effective dates! You just need to point out in the claim/appeal that the VA failed to rate the issues in the previous decision and **EXPLAIN** why the VA should have considered it or that you meet the criteria of a grant previously and the VA failed to grant.

    - Commonly missed ancillary benefits are things like [Special Monthly Compensation (SMC)](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/smc) and [Chapter 35](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/survivorbenefits#dea).

    - Commonly missed inferred conditions are things like [Residual scars](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/skin#7802) and secondary [Nerve issues](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/nerveindex) due to a [Spine](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/spine) condition.

      - NOTE: Inferring issues became policy circa 2014. So missed inferred issues prior to this year **CANNOT** be considered.
- The VA does not have a form for forgotten claims or CUES; So you can file via a [Personal statement](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/personal) or on a [(20-0995)](http://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-20-0995-ARE.pdf) to help the VA with keeping track of the claim.

- VBA does **NOT** have jurisdiction to call or handle CUEs on _any_ matters decided by BVA or higher courts. Meaning if BVA denied you and it is _somehow_ objectively a CUE, you **MUST** file a timely CAVC appeal or call a CUE against BVA to BVA.

  - This applies to **ANY** rating decisions on the matter made **BEFORE** the BVA or higher court decision on the matter.

    - If you were denied in 2011 for your back and also in 2019, to then be denied again by BVA in 2023. You could **NOT** call a CUE against the 2011 or 2019 decisions (to VBA). As it is assumed BVA has reviewed and found no CUEs in the prior decisions (regarding your back) already.
  - For information on how to call a CUE against BVA click [HERE](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/38/20.1404). (38 CFR 20.1404)

### CUE Examples

- Assigning incorrect SMC coding on your [Codesheet](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/ratingdecision#codesheet)

- [Bilateral factor](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vamath#bilateral) was not set properly in the master record (the codesheet derives its information from the master record)

  - Rater set your left ankle as a right ankle. This can result in being underpaid if the bilateral factor would have increased your combined evaluation. The master record is mentioned here because the codesheet does **NOT** display what bilateral factor is selected by the rater; only what diagnostic codes have an active bilateral factor that is impacting your combined evaluation.
- Conditions given a singular rating that should be rated separately

- Conditions given separate ratings that should have been given a combined singular evaluation

- [Effective dates](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/edate)

  - Missing intents to file, that claim was filed within a year of separation, not applying [Liberalizing law](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/edate#lib), etc.
- Granting/Denying service-connection/benefits

- [Rating](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/ratingsindex) (too high or too low)

- Rating decision took an action that resulted in reduced disability compensation payments and due process was **NOT** provided

### CUE Call Example

The rating decision dated March 2, 2025, made a clear and unmistakable error assigning an increased evaluation for my [PTSD](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental) to 50% effective October 23, 2024. When the evidence of record shows my claim for increase was received within one year of an [Intent to File (ITF)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/edate#itf). Therefore, the correct effective date of the increased evaluation for PTSD is January 6, 2024. (38 CFR 3.155, 38 CFR 3.400)

On January 6, 2024, VA received my completed ITF. On October 23, 2024, VA received my completed claim for increase on a VA Form 526EZ, for my PTSD. As my completed claim was received within a year of the ITF, the correct effective date is January 6, 2024.

## **Frequently** **Asked Questions**

- #### How do I check the status of my appeal?






- You can check the status of your appeals on [VA.gov](http://va.gov/), by calling 1 (800) 827-1000, or making a [VERA appointment](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vera).


- #### I filed my HLR/Supplemental claim via QuickSubmit and it has not shown up online yet?






- It can take a week or two before it will show up online.


- #### My appeal shows closed but my conditions are still unchanged. Have I been denied?






- It is possible, however the VA websites often do not update everything at the same time. So give it another day.

  - Alternatively, if you filed an HLR. If an error was found that required the VA to obtain new evidence then your HLR will be administratively closed and re-opened as a supplemental claim.

- #### You mentioned other power/authority DROs have?






- In addition to the ability to issue differences of opinions: DROs are allowed to declare CUEs (that do not harm the vet) without getting another person to approve their determination.


- #### During my HLR the VA found a duty to assist error and are sending me to another C&P exam. Can I now submit additional evidence, if I have some?






- Yes, your appeal has now become a supplemental claim. So you are free to [Submit](https://eauth.va.gov/accessva/?cspSelectFor=quicksubmit) any new and relevant evidence to your claim.


- #### How do I change review options at the Board?






- Fill out a new Board Appeal form. Make sure you check the box for the new review option, and list all of the issues.

  - **IMPORTANT:** You have **one year** from the date on the decision, or **60 days** from the date that you submitted your Board Appeal, whichever is later to make this change!

- #### How do I request different Board review options for different issues?






- You can submit one Board Appeal form and attach additional pages to explain how you want your issues reviewed, or you can submit multiple Board Appeal forms – one for each review option.


- #### I lost my BVA appeal, what can I do now?






- If you disagree with the Board’s decision and have new and relevant evidence that supports your case, you can file a Supplemental Claim. You can also appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims.


- #### How do I change my appeal from a Board Appeal to Supplemental Claim or Higher-Level Review?






- Tell the Board in writing that you wish to withdraw your Board Appeal. Then you can file a Supplemental Claim or Higher-Level Review.


- #### Should I hire an attorney/claims agent?






- That is a personal decision. However, unless your appeal hangs on a certain legal issue/angle then the benefit they provide may not be there.


- #### Can I file an appeal a specific condition decision, or do I have to appeal the entire claim?






- You can appeal a single decision, two, all of them, etc. Do know you **CANNOT** appeal the same condition via multiple appeal types at the same time!


- #### On the supplemental claim form, what does "Check this box if any issue listed below is being withdrawn from the legacy appeals process. OPT-IN from SOC/SSOC"?






- This box only applies to Veterans who are wanting to convert their 'legacy appeal' to the modern appeal processes. In short, unless you have been in a continuous appeal since circa 2017, this box does **NOT** apply to you and **CAN** be ignored.


- #### If I file an appeal, can the VA reduce my ratings?






- Yes, by filing an appeal you invite the VA to review your file. If it is found that a Clear and Unmistakable Error occurred and you were rated either too high or that service-connection was granted in error, the VA **WILL** start action to fix the error! That said, a mere difference of opinion is **NOT** enough! Further, if exams are ordered as apart of you claim and it is found that your condition(s) have improved, the VA _can_ start action to reduce you!


- #### Will I need to resubmit evidence that I previously submitted?






- No, the VA permanently keeps **ALL** records they receive.


- #### Will my pay be paused while the VA works on my appeal?






- Your pay will continue as appropriate, during the appeals process.


- #### Can I file multiple appeals on a single supplemental or HLR form?






- Yes.


- #### Will filing an appeal slow down any active claims/appeals I have?






- No, each appeal is processed separately from all other claims/appeals.

- In the event a separate appeal/claim hinges on the out outcome of its sister, then just the entangled issue(s) will be held in a waiting pattern till the primary issue is decided.


- #### Can I use a BVA case as evidence to support my own appeal?






- No, BVA cases do **NOT** establish precedence, only CAVC courts and higher do. However, you can try and use arguments presented in those cases.


- #### If I file a supplemental claim will I get new exam(s)?






- It is typical to get new exams or [Medical opinions](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/imo) when you file a supplemental. However, if your appeal does not properly address the rationale for the denial it may be found not appropriate to order you exams/opinions.


- #### My attorney/claim agent told me NOT TO TALK to the VA and that all communication needs to go through them?






- This is generally **VERY BAD** advice and serves more to drag out the length of an appeal (more money for them) than it would help you.

  - Further the VA will **NOT** honor a request for “exclusive contact” wherein the VA is prohibited from contacting the Veteran. You can of course refuse to respond/speak with the VA, as is your right - but you may find it best to answer questions as appropriate, especially if they are for the purposes of clarification.

- #### An "Attorney Fee" popped up on VA.gov?






- This is a **VERY STRONG** indication that your appeal was granted and VA is working on figuring how much your attorney/claim agent is owed.


- #### VA denied my CUE call but i am SURE they messed up and it is a CUE!






- If your CUE call was denied it is very likely not a CUE and may fall more into a [Duty to Assist (DTA)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/dta) error or a difference of opinion; both of which can never be the basis of a CUE. But if you are _super sure_ the rater messed up - you can file a HLR on the rating decision or take it to BVA.

  - If the rating decision that denied your CUE call was over a year ago you have **NO ABILITY** to call the same CUE again or have it reviewed (officially). Best you can do is file a valid unrelated claim/appeal and mention how you feel a CUE exists. A rater _may then_ look into the matter and call a CUE if they agree.
