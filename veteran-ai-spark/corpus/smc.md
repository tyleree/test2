In certain circumstances the VA will pay compensation to Veterans with certain needs or disabilities at a rate higher than 100%. This is called [Special Monthly Compensation](https://www.va.gov/disability/compensation-rates/special-monthly-compensation-rates/) (SMC).

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- Upper levels of SMC can get **VERY COMPLICATED**, especially with regard to [Pyramiding](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/ratingsindex#pyramiding) issues. As such, if you feel your level of SMC is incorrect you should file a [Higher Level Review](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals#hlr).

  - Upper level SMC would be considered levels _above_ L through T (but not S).

* * *

## **Applying**

SMC is something that is _generally_ automatically awarded and is not something you need to file for, when the VA has evidence you meet the requirement(s).

However, SMC K, Aid and Attendance SMC L, SMC R, SMC T, and Housebound (factually) are things you generally _do_ need to file for so VA can get the evidence required to support a grant.

- SMC K has no special forms or processes, simply file it as you would any [VA claim](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vaclaim).

- For information on how to apply for Aid and Attendance and Housebound click [HERE](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/aah).

- Applying for SMC is **NOT** _automatically_ considered to be a claim for increase; HOWEVER, the VA **CAN** treat it as such!


* * *

## **SMC Pay Rates**

Check the following link to see the [Latest rates](https://www.va.gov/disability/compensation-rates/special-monthly-compensation-rates/).

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- SMC is generally **NOT** paid in addition to the Veteran's rate.

  - The **EXCEPTIONS** to this are _SMC-K_ and _SMC-Q_. (SMC-Q is an obsolete rate that has not been used since 1968.)
- When hospitalized at government expense - SMCs pay rates above SMC L (besides S) **CAN** be **STOPPED**!


## **SMC K (Amputation/Loss of use of Body Part(s) or Function(s))**

SMC K is awarded to Veterans who have experienced loss of use or amputations of specific body parts/functions.

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- If you had an _elective_ vasectomy, you are **NOT** eligible for SMC K. **UNLESS**, you are service connected for [Erectile dysfunction](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/gensystem#7522) or other loss of use/amputation of reproductive organ(s) then you **ARE** entitled to SMC K!

- If you had an _elective_ hysterectomy, you are **NOT** eligible for SMC K. **UNLESS**, you are service connected for [Female sexual arousal disorder (FSAD)](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/femalesystem#7632) or other loss of use/amputation of reproductive organ(s) then you **ARE** entitled to SMC K!

- SMC-K is paid _on top_ of your disability compensation. **EXCEPT** in cases of SMC O, Q, R, and T.

  - In those cases, SMC K is **NOT** paid out.
- You can receive **up to 3** SMC K awards.


**PYRAMIDING NOTES:**

- A single award of SMC K is given for **EACH** limb that is lost or cannot function.

  - You **CANNOT** get the same award more than once per same limb (arm or leg). So you are only going to get a single SMC K for losing your left leg below the knee for instance.
- A single award of SMC K is given for loss of use of a reproductive organ, no matter how many bits n' bobs are lost or not functional. To include grants of erectile dysfunction or female sexual arousal disorder (FSAD).

- If the loss of use of a condition(s) is used as the basis of a grant of a higher SMC, the grant for SMC K will end! **HOWEVER**, if hospitalized at government expense, the SMC K(s) will be paid for the duration of the hospitalization.


**_LEGALIZED PYRAMIDING NOTE:_**

- If the Veteran has loss of use/amputation of 3 limbs the Veteran **IS ALLOWED** a grant of SMC K (for 1 of the limbs) in addition to their upper level SMC.


* * *

A Veteran _may_ also qualify if:

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- Policy-wise an additional eligibility requirement for aid and attendance is that the Veteran's [Service-connected](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/serviceconnection) disabilit(ities) that make up the basis for the need of aid and attendance must _generally_ be of a single disease process that [Combines](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vamath) to 100% or has an evaluation of 100%.

  - In the event aid and attendance is required but the above is _not_ met the rater is **REQUIRED** to get an advisory opinion from VA Central Office (VACO). These opinions tend to lean on the unfavorable side of things, so if you are denied you may have to appeal to the [Board of Veterans Appeals (BVA)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals#bva) since BVA is not bound by VA policy.
- Also consider applying for [Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers (PCAFC)](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/elderlt#pcafc).

## **SMC R (Special Aid and Attendance)**

## **SMC S (Housebound)/(Statutory Housebound)**

SMC S is awarded to Veterans who are permanently housebound in-fact or meet the ‘statutory requirements’.

* * *

### Housebound (In-Fact)

This requirement is met when the veteran is _substantially_ confined as a direct result of service-connected disabilities to his or her dwelling and the immediate premises or, if institutionalized, to the ward or clinical areas, and it is reasonably certain that the disability or disabilities and resultant confinement will continue throughout his or her lifetime.

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- Policy-wise the Veteran _should_ have service-connected disabilities that [Combine](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vamath) to _at least_ 100%.

- The Veteran leaving for medical appointments or occasional trips such as to places of worship are **NOT** considered to be reasons to deny housebound.


* * *

### Statutory Housebound

SMC S (statutory housebound) is awarded to Veterans who have a **SINGLE** 100% rating and a separate single 60% rating **_OR_** multiple ratings that combine [VA Math](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vamath) to at least 60%. IE two 40%, or eight 10%, etc.

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- A single disease process/injury **CANNOT** be considered as a singular 100% rating - if based on combining their separate evaluations.

  - For example: Having [Multiple Sclerosis](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/cns#8018) that had residuals that all combine to 100% - would **NOT** count as a singular 100%.
- A grant of [TDIU,](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/tdiu) _can_ count as a singular 100% rating. **HOWEVER**, if the grant of TDIU is based off of multiple conditions, then TDIU **CANNOT** be used in place of a single 100% rating!

  - TDIU granted off of a lump conditions (PTSD with TBI rated at 70%) _is_ considered a singular condition.

    - However the same is **NOT** true if the PTSD and TBI (or other conditions) are separately rated conditions (PTSD rated at 70% and TBI rated at 40%).
  - TDIU granted off a singular condition rated **UNDER** 60% does **NOT** count **UNLESS** an [Extra scheduler](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/ratingsindex#extra) determination is made.
- Awards of temporary 100% due to [Convalescence leave](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/ratingsindex#30) or [Hospitalization](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/ratingsindex#29) for a service-connected condition **DO** count for purposes of establishing a single 100% rating! After the temp 100% ends, entitlement to SMC S will be discontinued if the Veteran no longer meets the criteria for housebound or statutory housebound.
