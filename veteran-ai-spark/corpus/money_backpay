Common topics/questions around VA money matters.

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- Your VA education and VA disability benefits **CAN** be paid into _different_ accounts. Further, the VA does **NOT** share banking information internally - meaning you **MUST** inform the VA where you want your money to go for **BOTH** benefits! Failure to do so will result in you getting paper checks.

- VA pays in arrears! Meaning: You are paid at the end of the of the month for the same month. So - September is paid at the **END** of September, etc.

- This article is limited in scope and is _specifically_ about monies paid directly to the Veteran/dependent **AND** monies that are paid to _or_ withheld by the Department of Veteran Affairs.

## [**VA Disability**](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vaclaim)

The main source of money from the VA to Veterans.

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- VA does **NOT** prorate VA disability! Which means the effective date month of a grant/increase is **NOT** paid out (No increase for that month)!

- If your claim was decided mid-month; that month _may_ not be processed in time. Resulting to that month having to be paid out later as back pay.

- If a end of a month lands on a weekend. Your bank should pay you no later than the Friday going into that weekend. Of course, your bank may clear things sooner.

- You **CANNOT** be paid by the military/DoD and VA at the same time! Unless you are a retiree who served at least 20 years **AND** have at least a 50% [Combined](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vamath) VA rating.

  - If you are a civilian working for DoD you **CAN** receive your VA and civilian pay.

  - If you are return to active duty - your VA pay will be put on pause.

  - If you are National Guard or a Reservist - you will need to elect which pay you want to keep!
- If your increase claim was decided around the 20th of the month, your increase pay will likely **NOT** show up in that month's payment as that month's payment may have already been set to the US Treasury. This 'missed' payment will be paid out as back pay which may result in you getting two separate back payment amounts.

### Back Pay

When the VA finally decides your claim. You may be owed back pay.

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- VA disability **NEVER** prorates! It does not matter, if your [Effective date](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/edate) is the first or the last of the month - that **ENTIRE** month is **NOT** paid out!

- If you have [Staged](https://staged/) grants or back-dated grants that result in back pay - you will be paid the difference as appropriate.

  - For instance you were rated 30% in January 2023 and then you got a grant which increased your combined evaluation to 50% effective May 2023. In terms of back pay you would get the difference of the 50% and and 30% rates. Again remember the month of the increase is **NOT** paid out at the new 50% rate!
- Once a claim has been decided and closed out, it can take as short as a couple of days or up to two weeks before the money arrives in your account.

  - However, if you or your claim fall into one of the following situations your back pay _may_ take upward of a month due to requiring additional verification and auditing:

    - Your back pay is _greater than_ **$9,999**;

    - You are a DoD retiree;

    - You received [Separation/severance pay](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/recoupment); and/or

    - You have a private attorney (appeals only).

### Pay Tables

## **Education Benefits (** [**DEA**](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/survivorbenefits\#dea) **,** [**GI Bills**](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills) **, and** [**VR&E**](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vre) **)**

Housing benefits are paid directly to the person who is claiming the benefit.

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- You **CANNOT** get housing allowance while you are still Active Duty!

- The VA **DOES** prorate your housing allowance/DEA!

- Benefits are paid out by the Treasury Department using a **_10 business day window_** centered around the end of the month. Meaning - there is no specific date each month the Treasury is required to pay any VA education benefits.

- In order to get the Monthly Housing Allowance (MHA) you must be enrolled **OVER HALF TIME**! Those who are enrolled half time or less will **NOT GET ANY MHA**!

- MHA/DEA is prorated on a 30 day calendar. No matter how many days are actually in the month. So if a course started on Feb 21, you would be paid 9/30 the normal MHA amount for the month of Feb.

- Those who have courses that start/stop on different dates may have their amount of MHA reduced, if they fall below full time status.


* * *

### Prorate Examples

If your semester starts on August 23 then for the month of August (assuming you are full time and have 100% eligibility). You would be entitled to 26.7%\* of your normal monthly housing allowance (MHA).

\*8 days divided by 30 = 26.7%.

| Days | Prorated Amount |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | 3.3% |
| 5 | 16.7% |
| 15 | 50% |
| 20 | 66.7% |
| 25 | 83.3% |
| 30 | 100% |

## **Debts**

When you owe the VA money!

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- Administrative errors occur when VBA creates an overpayment due to mistakes in judgment or not applying laws properly. Veterans are **NOT** generally responsible for repaying overpayments that are found to be the result of administrative errors!

  - However, mistakes are generally **NOT** considered to be administrative errors if veterans are at fault because they took or failed to take an action, committed fraud with the intent of achieving financial or personal gain, or knew or should have reasonably known they were not entitled to the erroneous benefit.

* * *

## [Handling Debt](https://www.va.gov/manage-va-debt/)

Once the VA has identified that you owe a debt you will be sent a letter from the VA's Debt Management Center (DMC) informing you:

- How much you owe;

- When your first benefit check will be withheld/reduce, if you do you do not pay; and

- Your options going forward.


You have three options to handle debt:

- Pay the debt;

  - In full; or via a

  - Payment plan.
- Submit a compromise offer; or

- Request a waiver


* * *

#### Paying the Debt/Payment Plans

There was three different ways to pay the debt:

1. Phone: 1-800-827-0648 (or 1-612-713-6415 from overseas). Monday through Friday, 7:30 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. ET. If you have hearing loss, call TTY: 711.

2. Online through [Ask VA](https://www.va.gov/contact-us).

3. Snail mail:

U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Debt Management Center P.O. Box 11930 St. Paul, MN 55111


If you are unable to pay in full you **_CAN_** request a payment plan! To set up a payment plan you may contact the VA via any of the previous three methods above.

- You can have an amount taken from your VA payments _or_ pay the VA directly.


**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- If your payment plan would take _more_ than 5 years then you must additionally complete and submit a [VA Form 5655](http://www.va.gov/vaforms/va/pdf/VA5655.pdf).


* * *

#### Submitting a Compromise Offer

When you think a lesser amount is fair **AND** you are able to pay it all at once.

1. Contact the VA via one of the above options;

2. Complete and submit a [VA Form 5655](http://www.va.gov/vaforms/va/pdf/VA5655.pdf); and

3. A statement about your hardship.


**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- If the VA accepts your offer you have **30 days** to submit the **FULL** payment!


* * *

#### Requesting a Waiver

If having your benefits withheld/reduced would cause undue hardship you can request a waiver of the debt.

While you do have up to _180 days_ to request a waiver you should do so **IMMEDIATELY**!

To request a waiver:

1. Contact the VA via one of the above options;

2. Complete and submit a [VA Form 5655](http://www.va.gov/vaforms/va/pdf/VA5655.pdf); and

3. A statement about your hardship.


After you have requested a waiver one of three things will occur:

1. VA will forgive the entire debt;

2. VA will forgive _some_ of the debt; or

3. VA will forgive **NONE** of the debt.


* * *

## [Disability](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vaclaim)

The most common situations a VA disability debt is created are:

1. If you fail to notify the VA when you lose a [Dependent](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/depends) by death or divorce an over payment is created. Once the VA figures out this over payment exists, a debt will be created.

2. You received pay from DoD due to returning to active duty or by drilling, training, or being activated by the National Guard or Reserves (not retired pay).

   - If you want to get in front of the situation you can complete and submit a [VA Form 21-8951-2](http://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-21-8951-2-ARE.pdf).

   - Factors such as disability percentage, rank, and length of service will determine which pay (DoD or VA) is worth waiving. The quick math you would want to do would be DoD pays for a month vs. VA pays for the month. Whichever is lower, is the one you would want to waive.

* * *

## [Education](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills)

If you drop out/withdraw courses and the number of credits you are taking results in you falling **BELOW** what your school considers full time - a debt _may_ be created!

- For situations in which a debt _may_ not be created click [HERE](https://www.va.gov/resources/how-your-reason-for-withdrawing-from-a-class-affects-your-va-debt/).


* * *

## [Medical](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/healthcare)

Depending upon your [Combined](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/vamath)/Priority group or if your condition(s) are [Service-connected](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/serviceconnection). You may owe co-pays for treatment/medications.

- For information on VA Health care co-pays, click [HERE](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/healthcare#copay).

## **Recoupment**

When the VA wants to withhold money from _you_.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- These are not situations of indebtedness. There is no debt as nothing is technically _owed_ to the Department of Veterans Affairs, other agencies, or the federal government. Simply said, VA disability _cannot_ be paid out till the money provided by the DoD has equaled out.


* * *

### Separation/Severance Pay

- For information on this topic click [HERE](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/recoupment).


* * *

### Federal Tort Cases (Suing the VA)

If you are awarded a judgment against the United States (VA) in a civil action (Federal Tort Claim) due to the VA causing a disability **NO** increased disability benefits (based on those conditions) will be paid out _until_ the amount paid out to the Veteran via the judgement equals out.

- For more information click [HERE](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/1151).

## **Investing**

Generally, there are not any issues with how you invest money you get from the VA. However, there is a limitation in terms of ROTH IRAs.

* * *

### Limitation

Money obtained from the VA be it via disability or education **CANNOT** be used to fund ROTH IRAs. **UNLESS**, you have taxable income from other sources. In which cases, you may contribute up to the amount of your taxable income **OR** whatever the contribution cap is for a ROTH IRA for the year - whichever is **LOWER**.

[Return to top](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/money#top)

## **Living Abroad**

Living overseas will generally _not_ impact your ability to continue to receive monetary benefits from the VA.

However, in the following cases the U.S. Treasury is permitted to stop sending payments:

- The banking system in your country is unreliable and may result in the you never receiving payment; or

- You are living in a country identified as a [State sponsor of terrorism](https://www.state.gov/state-sponsors-of-terrorism/)


**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- Your payments will be made in U.S. dollars, **NOT** local currency.

## **Frequently** **Asked Questions**

- #### I randomly received money that I was not expecting. What is it for?






- Check your [Payment history](https://www.va.gov/va-payment-history) on [va.gov](http://va.gov/). It will plainly say which agency the money came from. Generally speaking, unexpected money is back pay from a positive outcome on a claim or an audit found that you were underpaid - such as never being paid your book stipend or it being paid incorrectly.


- #### My effective date was right but my back pay is wrong. How can I get this fixed?






- First things first: The month of your effective date is **NOT** paid out (FOR VA DISABILITY) and VA always pays in arrears (end of the month), so if your pay is off by 1-2 months it is likely because of these factors.

  - If you have accounted for these things and the math is _not_ mathing, you can call the VA at 1-800-827-1000 and ask that they do an audit.
