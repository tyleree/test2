or those who had to breathe all that bad air.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- These conditions do **NOT** have to rate at least 10% in order to be granted presumptive service-connection!


**RATER NOTES:**

- In the event a condition manifested **DURING** service either before **_OR_** after exposure, the VA will get a direct medical opinion.

  - If the direct opinion is _not_ favorable then the VA **WILL** grant presumptive - assuming there is nothing that clearly shows that something other than your exposure caused the condition when everything is properly considered.

  - This presumptive grant **IS** eligible for application of [Liberalizing law](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/edate#lib) as appropriate.
- In the event a condition manifested **BEFORE** service, the VA can get an [Aggravation](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/agg) medical opinion if appropriate.

## **Frequently** **Asked Questions**

- #### I am an eligible Veteran and I was diagnosed with a listed disability but I was denied. What can I do?






- Sometimes the VBA makes a mistake or they are missing evidence that would indicate you are an eligible Veteran with a diagnosed condition. If this happens, it is strongly recommended that you seek out the assistance of a [VSO](https://www.va.gov/ogc/apps/accreditation/index.asp) to help you file an [Appeal](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/Appeals).


Additionally,

- If there is documentation that during service the Veteran's exposure was due to their own willful misconduct or that after the Veteran's separation there was a supervening condition or event that was more than likely the etiology of the disease, the Veteran may be denied service-connection.
