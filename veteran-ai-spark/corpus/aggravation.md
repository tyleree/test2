There are two flavors of service-connection by aggravation:

1. Aggravation of a preexisting (pre-service) condition by military service; and

2. Aggravation of a existing (post-service) by a service-connected condition.


Unlike the other forms of service-connection, aggravation has an extra layer of complication in determining your rating.

* * *

## **Aggravation of a Preexisting (Pre-service) Condition**

When your military service worsens a preexisting condition

Before you joined the military you underwent a physical examination at a Military Entrance Processing Station (MEPS). During this examination any preexisting issues is recorded. Anything **NOT** recorded during that examination, the VA is instructed to 'presume soundness' - that is, if nothing is recorded that the Veteran came in with nothing wrong!

Now with that said, there are _exceptions_:

- If a _chronic_ condition is diagnosed shortly after service starts, **AND** it could be medically concluded ( _more likely than not_) that this condition existed before service - the VA will just **NOT** assume the condition just popped up during service.

  - This said, it is _still_ possible to get service-connection!
- If medical evidence shows a condition existed prior to service.

  - Examples include: medical records dated **BEFORE** service or x-rays done in service that show well healed preexisting bone fractures.

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- Statements from the Veteran themselves _or_ others that a condition existed **BEFORE** service hold **ZERO WEIGHT**! **UNLESS**, there is medical evidence that backs up those statements!

- If DoD **LOST** your entrance physical paperwork, the VA is to assume you entered into service with no issues (barring the previously mentioned exceptions).

- Periods of [IADT](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/ngr) service; which did **NOT** have an entrance physical conducted prior to the period of service do **NOT** carry this presumption of soundness!


* * *

### Setting Up Consideration

```
So medical records indicated that a condition existed before service:
```

In order for the VA to consider a condition under aggravation of a preexisting (pre-service) condition the VA must establish two things:

1. What the level of severity\* was **BEFORE** service; and

2. What the level of severity was **DURING/AFTER** service.


\*severity for VA purposes is as established by the [Rating schedule](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/ratingsindex).

For number one, in _most_ cases (unless you say got a medical waiver), your severity before service will be established as 0%.

Now number two, is where things get tricky for a lot of Veterans...

The VA **NEEDS** proof that your service made your condition worse! If there are **NO** complaints _or_ treatment made in service for the preexisting condition - [You Lose! Good day sir!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpK36FZmTFY) For the most part...

- _However_, there is _still_ some hope! You can submit [Buddy statements](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/buddy) in support of your claim! Alternatively, if the source of your aggravation is related to combat then you do **NOT** need documentation! You just need to submit a [Personal statement](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/personal) explaining how the injury that aggravated your condition occurred.

- Additionally, if your aggravation occurred as a result of a specialized skill IE parachutist. You can state as much, as it is fairly well established that taking hard landings can mess stuff up.


* * *

### Making a Decision

The VA now armed with elements one and two - can now get a medical opinion on aggravation.

The VA will now ask a medical professional to provide a medical opinion as to if your military service _permanently_ worsened your preexisting condition at least as likely as not beyond it's natural progression.

If the opinion is favorable then you are good to go.

## **Aggravation of an Existing (Post-service) Condition**

If your service-connected condition (or a condition that eventually becomes service-connected) aggravates an existing condition it can be service-connected.

* * *

### Setting Up Consideration

In order for the VA to consider a condition under aggravation of an existing (post-service) condition the VA must establish two things:

1. What the level of severity\* was **BEFORE** aggravation; and

2. What the level of severity was **AFTER** aggravation.


\*severity for VA purposes is as established by the [Rating schedule](https://veteransbenefitskb.com/ratingsindex).

It is **REQUIRED** that you supply medical evidence to the VA that shows the level of severity of the condition **BEFORE** aggravation, **OR** as soon as possible after aggravation, _but_ before the date of receipt of the evidence establishing the _current_ level of severity of the aggravated condition.

- In short - if you do not show the VA how much your service-connected condition aggravated a condition, you **CANNOT** get service-connection!


* * *

### Making a Decision

The VA now armed with elements one and two - can now get a medical opinion on aggravation.

The VA will now ask a medical professional to provide a medical opinion as to if your service-connected condition worsened your existing condition at least as likely as not beyond it's natural progression.

If the opinion is favorable then you are good to go.

## **Rating Aggravated Conditions**

Rating service-connected aggravated conditions has an additional layer of complication. Instead of the traditional assigning a rating based upon the rating schedule, aggravated conditions involve some subtraction:

> ```
>  Current severity - preexisting condition severity = aggravated rating
> ```

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- If the preexisting (pre-service) condition would rate 100% severity, the final aggravated rating **WILL BE** 100%!

  - This does **NOT** apply to aggravations of conditions **AFTER** separation!
- If the VA cannot determine the severity of a _preexisting (pre-service)_ condition, the VA will assume the severity was 0%.


* * *

### Examples Preexisting (Pre-Service)

| Current Severity | Preexisting Severity | Aggravated Rating |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0% | -0% | =0% |
| 30% | -30% | =0% |
| 50% | -10% | =40% |
| 70% | -50% | =20% |
| 100% | -100% | = **100%** |

* * *

### Examples Existing (Post-Service)

| Current Severity | Preexisting Severity | Aggravated Rating |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0% | -0% | =0% |
| 30% | -30% | =0% |
| 50% | -10% | =40% |
| 70% | -50% | =20% |
| 100% | -100% | =0% |
