## **Finding a Provider**

CHAMPVA does not have a network of providers. As such it is recommended you visit the [Medicare website](https://www.medicare.gov/) or [TRICARE website](https://tricare.mil/FindDoctor) to find a doctor.

Generally, providers who accept Medicare, Medicaid, or TRICARE also accept CHAMPVA - but they may not be familiar with the program and incorrectly assume that it is a group health insurance plan rather than a government health care program.

If the receptionist tells you they don't accept CHAMPVA, ask the billing department - sometimes they are the only ones that _really_ know!

* * *

### Providers that Accept “Assignment” for VA Family Member Programs

When you locate a medical provider, confirm that they will participate in the VA family member health care program you belong to. Providers most often refer to participation as "accepting assignment." Providers that accept assignment will bill the VA directly for covered services, items and supplies. Doctors or other providers who accept assignment must accept the VHA Office of Community Care (VHA OCC) allowable amount as payment-in-full and cannot collect additional amounts from you beyond your cost share and deductible.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- All hospitals that participate in Medicare, and hospital-based health care professionals who are employed by, or contracted to, such hospitals are **required** by law to accept the VHA OCC allowable amount for inpatient hospital services.


* * *

### Providers that do **NOT** Accept “Assignment” for VA Family Member Programs

If your provider does not accept assignment, you can still see that provider, but be aware that you will likely have to pay the entire charge at the time of service. Additionally, you may be charged more than the VHA OCC allowable amount.

Providers that do not accept assignment are not permitted to file for reimbursement. If you choose to use them, you will have to submit for reimbursement yourself.

To obtain reimbursement in cases where a VA family member health care program is your only insurance, you will have to submit the itemized bill from the provider along with the appropriate VA form. When the claim is processed, the VA will send you the VHA OCC share of the allowable amount.

What this means to you is that when the medical provider does **NOT** accept assignment, your cost will include not only your share of our determined allowable amount, but _also_ any charges over the VA's allowable amount.

## **Benefits**

In general, CHAMPVA covers most health care services and supplies that are medically and psychologically necessary. Upon confirmation of eligibility, you will receive a [CHAMPVA Program Guide](https://www.va.gov/COMMUNITYCARE/docs/pubfiles/programguides/CHAMPVA-Guide.pdf) that specifically addresses covered and non-covered services and supplies.

Dental care is **NOT** covered **UNLESS** you also enroll in [VA Dental Insurance Program (VADIP)](https://www.va.gov/health-care/about-va-health-benefits/dental-care/dental-insurance/).

For a complete listing of non-covered services and supplies consult the [CHAMPVA Policy Manual](https://www.vha.cc.va.gov/).

## **Frequently** **Asked Questions**

- #### What does CHAMPVA pay?






- In most cases, CHAMPVA's allowable amount (what VA pays) for specific services and supplies—is equivalent to Medicare/TRICARE rates. CHAMPVA has an outpatient deductible ($50 per beneficiary per calendar year or a maximum of $100 per family per calendar year) and a patient cost share of 25% of our allowable amount up to the catastrophic cap ($3,000 per calendar year). Beneficiaries should NOT send checks to VHA OCC for their annual deductible; as claims are processed, charges are automatically credited to individual and family deductible requirements for each calendar year.

- If your provider accepts assignment, which means the provider accepts CHAMPVA, the provider agrees to accept the VA's allowable amount as payment in full. A provider cannot bill you for the difference between the VA's allowable amount and their normally billed amount.

- If the patient has other health insurance, then CHAMPVA pays the lesser of either 75% of the allowable amount after the $50 calendar year deductible is satisfied, or the remainder of the charges and the beneficiary will normally have no cost share.


- #### How long will it take for me to get a response after applying?






4-6 months.

- #### I need coverage NOW but it is taking forever to get approved for CHAMPVA! What can I do?






Pay out of pocket for now and to file for reimbursement once you are finally approved.

- #### Can the Veteran get coverage under CHAMPVA?






Only if they are eligible via their spouse or being a caregiver as noted previously.

- #### Are health care services at VA facilities available to CHAMPVA beneficiaries?






- Only at participating VA facilities (most VA facilities do **NOT** participate).

- Under the CHAMPVA In-house Treatment Initiative (CITI), CHAMPVA beneficiaries may receive cost-free health care services at _participating_ VA facilities.


- #### How can I find out if the local VA facility is participating in the CITI program?






Follow the following [link](https://www.va.gov/COMMUNITYCARE/programs/dependents/champva/CITI-Facilities.asp).

- #### What out-of-pocket expenses can a CHAMPVA beneficiary expect under CITI?






None. CHAMPVA beneficiaries don’t pay out-of-pocket expenses when receiving services under the CITI program.

- #### Can a dependent parent parent be covered under CHAMPVA?






- No. According to [38 CFR § 17.271 - Eligibility](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/38/17.271) they are **NOT** eligible (outside of being an appropriate caregiver)


- #### Can CHAMPVA act as primary insurance if I have another insurance?






- **NO _UNLESS_** the other insurance is:

  - Medicaid;

  - State Victims of Crime Compensation Programs;

  - Indian Health Services; or

  - Supplemental CHAMPVA policies.

- #### Can CHAMPVA be secondary (supplemental insurance) if I have another insurance?






- **YES _UNLESS_** the other insurance is:

  - Medicaid;

  - State Victims of Crime Compensation Programs;

  - Indian Health Services; or

  - Supplemental CHAMPVA policies.

- #### If CHAMPVA is secondary how does the billing work?






- Your health care provider should bill the other insurance first. The provider should then submit the Explanation of Benefits (EOB) from the other insurance along with the claim for reimbursement to CHAMPVA.


- #### My spouse is pregnant when can we add our new child?






- You won’t be able to add them till they have a Social Security Number. Once you get it, be sure to [Claim](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/depends) them as a dependent and **THEN** apply to have them added to CHAMPVA.


- #### Since it takes so long for approval what's going to happen to the bills related to my newborn?






- Don’t worry! The hospital and billing staff are well aware it is a process to get newborns added to insurance. With most not requiring you to pay immediately.

  - In short, once the child has been added, go ahead and let the appropriate billing offices know their details and you will be fine.

  - For procedures/treatment which may have required you to pay out of pocket - you will need to file a claim with CHAMPVA to seek reimbursement.

- #### My dependent's application was denied because they are eligible for TRICARE; when they should not be?






1. Double check to see if DEERS has you listed as eligible or not.

   - Click [HERE](https://tricare.mil/Plans/Eligibility/DEERS/milConnect/Proof) to see if you are listed as eligible for TRICARE coverage.
2. If you think your eligibility is listed incorrectly call DMDC/DEERS support at 1-800-538-9552 and explain why you think it is wrong IE you are a Gray Area Retiree under 60 years of age.

   - The keyword in their system is “Direct”, it needs to be removed.
3. With DEERS now updated, submit a question to AskVA to have your denial looked into again. Be sure to include your denial case number/application ID.

   - Click [HERE](https://www.va.gov/contact-us/ask-va/introduction) to use AskVA.
4. The VA should then review the denial and grant CHAMPVA!


- #### I am a Gray/Grey Area Retiree and I am having issues getting my dependent(s) approved?






- Please see the answer to the previous question.


- #### Can CHAMPVA be used overseas?






- Yes! If you live or travel overseas (excluding countries that are restricted or prohibited by the U.S. Department of Treasury), CHAMPVA will provide the **SAME** benefits. If the billing and medical documentation are written in a foreign language, translation will be arranged at no cost to you; but if you want to speed up the process you may translate things to English. Payments are made in U.S. dollars.
