# 🚀 Production Deployment Fix

## Issues Identified:

1. **❌ CSP Error**: USHeatMap component trying to fetch from `cdn.jsdelivr.net`
2. **❌ 401 Error**: Analytics API endpoints returning unauthorized

## ✅ Fixes Applied:

### 1. Content Security Policy Fix
- **Removed**: USHeatMap component that was causing CSP violations
- **Result**: No more external CDN requests that violate CSP

### 2. Route Organization Fix
- **Fixed**: Route ordering in Flask app
- **Added**: Specific `/analytics` route for legacy URL support
- **Added**: Debug logging to track authentication issues

### 3. Authentication Debug
- **Added**: Logging to see what tokens are being received
- **Added**: Header inspection for troubleshooting

## 🔧 For Render.com Deployment:

### Step 1: Build the Frontend
```bash
npm run build
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Render
1. **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt && npm install && npm run build`
2. **Start Command**: `python app.py`
3. **Environment Variables**:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key
   PINECONE_API_KEY=your-key
   PINECONE_ENV=your-env
   PINECONE_INDEX=your-index
   ```

### Step 3: Test URLs
After deployment, test:
- `https://your-service.onrender.com/` - Main app
- `https://your-service.onrender.com/analytics?token=flip_ruby:1` - Analytics
- `https://your-service.onrender.com/admin/analytics?token=flip_ruby:1` - Admin

## 🎯 Expected Results:

✅ **No CSP Errors**: USHeatMap removed
✅ **No 401 Errors**: Proper Flask route handling
✅ **Working Timeline**: Full question tracking
✅ **Working Analytics**: Real-time metrics

## 📊 Production Architecture:

```
User Request → Render.com → Flask App
                              ├── Serves React SPA (/)
                              ├── Analytics API (/api/analytics/stats)
                              ├── Timeline API (/api/analytics/timeline)
                              └── Static Assets (/assets/*)
```

The single Flask service handles everything:
- ✅ React SPA serving
- ✅ API endpoints for analytics
- ✅ Authentication with tokens
- ✅ Static file serving

**This should resolve both the CSP and 401 authentication errors in production!** 🚀
