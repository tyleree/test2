# Sample Documentation

## Overview

This is a sample documentation file for testing the RAG chatbot system. It contains information about various topics that can be used to demonstrate the question-answering capabilities.

## Features

The RAG chatbot system includes the following features:

- **Document Ingestion**: Automatically processes markdown, HTML, and text files
- **Semantic Search**: Uses embeddings to find relevant content
- **Citation Generation**: Provides inline citations and source references
- **Token Optimization**: Minimizes token usage through smart chunking and summarization

## Getting Started

To get started with the system:

1. Set up your environment variables
2. Install the required dependencies
3. Ingest your documents using the `/ingest` endpoint
4. Start asking questions via the `/ask` endpoint

## Technical Details

### Architecture

The system is built with:
- Flask for the web API
- Pinecone for vector storage
- OpenAI for embeddings and completions
- tiktoken for token counting

### Performance

The system is optimized for:
- Low latency responses
- Minimal token usage
- High-quality citations
- Accurate retrieval

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

- **Connection errors**: Check your API keys
- **No results**: Verify documents are properly ingested
- **Poor quality**: Adjust the score threshold
- **High costs**: Reduce context tokens or use cheaper models
