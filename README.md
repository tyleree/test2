## 📊 Analytics System

### Overview
The application includes a comprehensive analytics system that tracks:
- **Pageviews**: Every page visit and SPA navigation
- **Unique Visitors**: Anonymous session-based tracking (no PII)
- **Chat Questions**: Count of AI assistant interactions
- **Geographic Data**: Visitor locations displayed on a heat map
- **Daily Metrics**: Time-series data for trends

### Database Setup
The analytics system uses PostgreSQL for data persistence:

1. **For Render Deployment**: The `render.yaml` file automatically provisions a PostgreSQL database
2. **For Local Development**: Set `DATABASE_URL` in your environment:
   ```bash
   export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname"
   ```

### Environment Variables
Required for analytics functionality:
```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/database
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-for-sessions
ADMIN_TOKEN=your-admin-token-for-dashboard-access
```

### Analytics Dashboard
Access the analytics dashboard at `/admin/analytics?token=YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN`

**Features:**
- **Real-time Statistics**: Total pageviews, unique visitors, chat questions
- **Daily Breakdown**: Day-by-day metrics for the last 30 days
- **Top Pages**: Most visited pages on your site
- **Top Referrers**: Sources of incoming traffic
- **Geographic Heat Map**: US states heat map showing visitor distribution

### API Endpoints

#### Collect Events
```http
POST /api/analytics/event
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "type": "pageview" | "chat_question",
  "path": "/current-page",
  "ref": "https://referrer.com/",
  "meta": {"custom": "data"}
}
```

#### Get Statistics
```http
GET /api/analytics/stats?days=30
```

Returns comprehensive analytics data including totals, daily breakdown, top pages, and referrers.

### Client-Side Tracking
The analytics system automatically tracks:
- **Page Loads**: Initial page visits
- **SPA Navigation**: Single-page app route changes
- **Chat Interactions**: When users submit questions

**Manual Tracking:**
```javascript
// Track custom pageview
window.analyticsTrack('/custom-page', {custom: 'metadata'});

// Track chat interaction
window.analyticsChatHit({prompt_length: 50});
```

### Privacy & Security
- **No PII**: Only anonymous session IDs, no personal information
- **IP Privacy**: IP addresses stored for geolocation only
- **Secure Cookies**: HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Lax
- **Strict CSP**: Content Security Policy without unsafe-eval
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in protection against abuse

### Data Retention
- Events are stored indefinitely by default
- Consider implementing data retention policies for production
- Geographic data is aggregated at the state level (US) or country level (international)

### Troubleshooting

**Database Connection Issues:**
```bash
# Check if DATABASE_URL is set
echo $DATABASE_URL

# Verify database connectivity
python -c "from db import engine; print('✅ Database connected' if engine else '❌ No connection')"
```

**Missing Analytics Data:**
1. Verify `DATABASE_URL` is properly configured
2. Check that `/static/analytics.js` is being served
3. Ensure `ADMIN_TOKEN` is set for dashboard access
4. Check browser console for JavaScript errors

**Performance Optimization:**
- Analytics events are collected asynchronously
- Database queries use indexes for optimal performance
- Failed analytics calls don't impact site functionality
