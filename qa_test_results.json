Here are the key points for rating:\n\n- Blood pressure readings must be taken two or more times on at least three different days to properly diagnose hypertension.\n- Veterans can receive a separate rating for hypertension even if they have hypertensive heart disease.\n- Veterans with hypertension due to aortic insufficiency or hyperthyroidism will not receive a separate rating for hypertension.\n- Hypertension can be considered a presumptive condition if:\n  - It is diagnosed within a year of separation and was at least 10% disabling within that time,\n  - The veteran was exposed to Agent Orange,\n  - The veteran was a POW and the severity was at least 10% at some point.\n- There is also quasi presumptive service-connection for veterans who develop hypertension after certain amputations.\n\nThe specific rating percentages and criteria are not fully detailed in the provided context, but the process and requirements for diagnosis and rating eligibility are outlined\u00b9.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [DC 7101 - High Blood Pressure - (rating_table)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/bloodtubes#7101)",

        "content": "The rating criteria for depression (and other mental health disorders) are based on the severity of the totality of a veteran's symptoms, not the specific diagnosis. Veterans receive a single rating regardless of the number of mental health diagnoses they have. The rating is determined by how closely the veteran's symptoms match the criteria for each percentage level, considering all evidence submitted, such as examiner's reports, personal statements, and treatment notes.\n\nFor example, the 50% rating criteria for depression (and other mental disorders) are:\n\n- Occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity due to such symptoms as:\n  - Flattened affect\n  - Circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech\n  - Panic attacks more than once a week\n  - Difficulty in understanding complex commands\n  - Impairment of short- and long-term memory (e.g., retention of only highly learned material, forgetting to complete tasks)\n  - Impaired judgment\n  - Impaired abstract thinking\n  - Disturbances of motivation and mood\n  - Difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships\n\nAdditional notes for the 50% rating:\n- Mostly able to care for themselves, though hygiene may not always be maintained\n- Able to do daily tasks (driving, shopping, chores), but may occasionally be hospitalized\n- Can work, but may have difficulty staying employed for long periods\n- May be able to form relationships, but they may be short-lived due to difficulty being an active participant\n- Symptoms may include extreme lack of motivation, mood swings, inappropriate emotional responses, frequent panic attacks, severe anxiety, difficulty with complex directions, and poor judgment\u00b3\n\nThe rating is ultimately based on the totality of symptoms and how closely they match the criteria for each percentage level, not just the presence of a diagnosis like depression.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Mental Disorder Ratings - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)\n\u00b2 [How a Rater Decides - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/cnp)\n\u00b3 [50% - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)",

        "content": "Degenerative Disc Disease (DDD) can be rated under two main criteria based on the context provided:\n\n### 1. Incapacitating Episodes (DC 5243)\nIf a Veteran with DDD (also known as Intervertebral Disc Syndrome or IVDS) has incapacitating episodes requiring **prescribed** bed rest within a 12-month period, the following ratings apply:\n\n- **10%**: At least 1 but less than 2 weeks of prescribed bed rest\n- **20%**: At least 2 but less than 4 weeks\n- **40%**: At least 4 but less than 6 weeks\n- **60%**: More than 6 weeks\n\n**Note:** The Veteran can be rated based on either incapacitating episodes or range of motion (ROM), but not both. The higher rating is used. If rated under this schedule, separate ratings for related spine nerve conditions are **not** allowed\u00b9.\n\n### 2. Limitations of Range of Motion (ROM) (DC 5235\u20135242)\nIf the Veteran does not meet the criteria for incapacitating episodes, DDD may be rated based on limitation of motion of the spine. Only one rating per section of the spine (neck or middle/lower back) is allowed, even if multiple conditions affect the same section\u00b3.\n\n#### Thoracolumbar (Back) Ratings:\n- **0%**: Forward flexion \u2265 90\u00b0, or combined ROM \u2265 240\u00b0\n- **10%**: Forward flexion > 60\u00b0 but \u2264 85\u00b0, or combined ROM 125\u00b0\u2013240\u00b0\n- (Further criteria are truncated in the context)\n\n#### Cervical (Neck) Ratings:\n- **0%**: Forward flexion \u2265 45\u00b0, or combined ROM \u2265 340\u00b0\n- **10%**: Forward flexion > 30\u00b0 but < 45\u00b0, or combined ROM 175\u00b0\u2013340\u00b0\n- (Further criteria are truncated in the context)\n\n**Note:** Only the most impaired ROM measurements should be used, including estimates for flare-ups if not directly observed during examination\u2076.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- DDD is **not** considered arthritis and is not subject to presumptive service connection for arthritis\u00b2.\n- If a Veteran qualifies for both ROM and incapacitating episode ratings, only the higher rating is applied, not both\u00b9 \u2077.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [DC 5243 - Rating Based off Incapacitating Episodes](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/digsystem#5243)  \n\u00b2 [Arthritis of the Spine - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/spine)  \n\u00b3 [DC 5235 - through 5242 Ratings Based Off Limitations of Range of Motion - (rating_table)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/nervesystem#5235)  \n\u2076 [Rating Schedule for the Knee and Lower Leg - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/ratingsindex)  \n\u2077 [Miscellaneous - (rating_table)](https://veteransbenefitskb.com)",

Our internal confidence score is **47.6%** for this response - please verify the answer with your own due diligence. A report has been generated and someone will review this.\n\nNehmer refers to a VA policy under 38 CFR 3.816 that requires the VA to grant earlier effective dates for service connection (SC) of certain presumptive conditions related to Agent Orange exposure when those conditions were denied before they became presumptive. This policy applies to conditions named in 38 CFR 3.309(e), except chloracne, and mandates the VA to review prior decisions and adjust effective dates accordingly when a new presumptive condition is added. However, Nehmer does not apply if the original claim was denied before September 25, 1985, or if the claim was filed after the condition became presumptive. Conditions like hypertension and MGUS are currently not eligible for Nehmer consideration. Nehmer allows veterans to receive service connection effective from the date of the initial claim or evidence of diagnosis, even if the condition was not yet presumptive at that time.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Nehmer Class Members (38 CFR 3.816) (Part 4) - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/agentorange#nehmerclassmembers38)  \n\u00b2 [Nehmer Class Members (38 CFR 3.816) (Part 3) - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/agentorange#nehmerclassmembers38)",
