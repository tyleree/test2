        "content": "To file a VA disability claim, you have several options:\n\n- File online by yourself at VA.gov: [https://www.va.gov/disability/how-to-file-claim/](https://www.va.gov/disability/how-to-file-claim/) or directly file the VA Form 21-526EZ online at [https://www.va.gov/disability/file-disability-claim-form-21-526ez/](https://www.va.gov/disability/file-disability-claim-form-21-526ez/)\u00b3\u2076.\n- Use a Veterans Service Officer (VSO) to assist you with filing. VSOs can help you prepare and submit your claim properly. You can find a VSO near you at [https://www.va.gov/ogc/apps/accreditation/index.asp](https://www.va.gov/ogc/apps/accreditation/index.asp)\u00b9\u00b3.\n- File by fax: send VA Form 21-526EZ to 844-531-7818\u00b3.\n- File in person: complete VA Form 21-526EZ and submit it at your nearest VA Regional Office\u00b3.\n- File by mail: send the completed VA Form 21-526EZ to the Department of Veterans Affairs Claims Intake Center, PO Box 4444, Janesville, WI 53547-4444\u00b3.\n\nImportant notes:\n- If you have a VSO file your claim, you must personally sign the claim paperwork if this is your first claim\u00b2.\n- You do not need to have a diagnosis to file a claim\u00b2.\n- The VA processes claims based on the date they are received and processed, not the postmark date\u00b3.\n- If you file a new claim while another is active, the VA will close the new claim but combine the issues with the active claim\u00b3.\n\nIt is strongly recommended to use a VSO to help with the process, although you can file on your own if you prefer\u2074.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Filing a VA Disability Claim](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vaclaim)  \n\u00b2 [Filing a BDD Claim](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vaclaim)  \n\u00b3 [Filing a Claim](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vaclaim)  \n\u2074 [How to File](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals)  \n\u2076 [How do I file a claim for disability compensation?](https://www.va.gov/disability/eligibility/hazardous-materials-exposure/camp-lejeune-water-contamination/#howdoifileaclaimfordisabilitycompensation)",

        "content": "A C&P (Compensation and Pension) exam is a medical examination scheduled by the VA as part of the disability claims process. It is used to evaluate the severity of a veteran's service-connected disabilities to determine the appropriate disability rating and benefits. Veterans can request a specific contractor or VA medical center for their exam or ask for a tele-health appointment for certain types of exams, such as mental health. The VA will attempt to honor these requests if reasonable and possible. Veterans are usually scheduled for a C&P exam shortly after filing their claim, but in some cases, the exam may be delayed or not scheduled at all. It is important for veterans to keep their contact information up-to-date to avoid missing exam notifications\u00b9\u2075.\n\nVeterans can also review Disability Benefits Questionnaires (DBQs) related to their condition to understand how the C&P exam will be conducted. DBQs are forms used by examiners to document the severity of a disability and can sometimes be completed by a veteran's own physician to support a claim\u00b2\u00b3\u2074\u2076\u2077.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Compensation & Pension Examinations (C&P)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/cnp)  \n\u2075 [After Submitting a Claim](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vaclaim)  \n\u00b2 [Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQs)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/cnp)  \n\u00b3 [Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQs)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/cnp)  \n\u2074 [Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQs)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/cnp)  \n\u2076 [Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQs)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/cnp)  \n\u2077 [Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQs)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/cnp)",

        "content": "To prepare for a Compensation and Pension (C&P) exam, consider the following steps based on the provided information:\n\n- Review the applicable Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) related to your condition. DBQs give you an idea of what the C&P exam will cover and the type of information the examiner will be looking for. You can also ask your treating physician to complete a DBQ on your behalf to submit with your claim. Examples of DBQs include those for cervical spine, thoracolumbar spine, traumatic brain injury (TBI), cranial nerve conditions, arthritis, fibromyalgia, and osteomyelitis\u00b3\u2075\u2077.\n\n- If you have preferences regarding the location or type of your exam (for example, if you want a specific contractor, VA medical center, or a tele-health appointment), you can include a personal statement with your request. The VA will attempt to honor reasonable requests\u00b9.\n\n- Keep your contact information (mailing address, email, and phone number) up to date with the VA to ensure you receive timely notice of your exam appointment\u2074.\n\n- Attend the exam as scheduled. Missing a C&P exam, especially for reevaluations, can lead to loss of benefits or reduction in your disability rating\u2076.\n\nBy reviewing the relevant DBQ and ensuring your contact information is current, you will be better prepared for your C&P exam.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Compensation & Pension Examinations (C&P)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/cnp)  \n\u00b2 [Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQs)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/cnp)  \n\u00b3 [Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQs)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/cnp)  \n\u2074 [After Submitting a Claim](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vaclaim)  \n\u2075 [Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQs)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/cnp)  \n\u2076 [Permanent and Total (P&T) Disability - FAQ](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/pnt#faq)  \n\u2077 [Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQs)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/cnp)",

        "content": "An Intent to File is the first step in filing a VA disability claim. It is important because it preserves your effective date, which determines the date from which you will receive payments. For recently separated Veterans, an Intent to File can be automatically opened the day after separation, and if filed before the one-year separation anniversary, it can extend the time to file a claim by an additional year while still allowing back pay from the day after separation\u00b9.\n\nAn Intent to File can be submitted in several ways, including online at VA.gov, through a Veterans Service Officer (VSO), by phone, in person using VA Form 21-0966, by fax, or by mail. The VA uses the date the Intent to File is processed, not the postmark date. An Intent to File is valid for one year and can be used for one claim, which may cover multiple conditions. If multiple claims or appeals are filed on the same day, they will all fall under the same Intent to File\u00b2.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Intent to File - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vaclaim)  \n\u00b2 [Starting an Intent to File - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vaclaim)",

The letter typically includes the doctor's credentials, the veteran's diagnosis, a review of the veteran's medical history and service records, and an explanation of how the veteran's condition is connected to their military service or why other risk factors are less likely causes.

        "content": "Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD) is a VA program that allows active duty servicemembers who are between 180 and 90 days before separation to file a disability claim within that window. The goal of BDD is to enable the claim to be processed so that the veteran can receive a decision on their claim the day after they separate from active duty. However, this outcome is not guaranteed. To participate in BDD, servicemembers must submit their Service Treatment Records (STRs) no later than 90 days before separation, including the Separation Health Assessment - Part A Self-Assessment (SHA, Part A). Private medical records are generally not included in STRs unless the veteran arranges to have them added. Veterans do not need to complete all required exams before separation or before the filing window closes. It is important to keep the VA updated with current contact information to receive notifications about examinations and claim status\u00b9\u2074.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD) - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/digsystem)  \n\u2074 [Active Duty Servicemembers - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/cnp)",

Aggravation of a preexisting (pre-service) condition by military service.\n2. Aggravation of an existing (post-service) condition by a service-connected condition.\n\nIn both cases, the condition becomes service-connected because the military service or a service-connected condition has worsened it beyond its natural progression\u00b9.\n\nFor aggravation of an existing (post-service) condition, the VA must establish the level of severity before and after aggravation and obtain a medical opinion that the service-connected condition worsened the existing condition at least as likely as not\u00b2.\n\nFor aggravation of a preexisting (pre-service) condition, the VA uses evidence such as the Military Entrance Processing Station (MEPS) exam and medical records to determine if the condition existed before service and was worsened by service\u2074.\n\nRating of aggravated conditions involves subtracting the preexisting condition's severity from the current severity to determine the aggravated rating, with some special rules depending on whether the condition was pre-service or post-service\u2075.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Service-Connection by Aggravation](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/agg#serviceconnectionbyaggravation)  \n\u00b2 [Aggravation of an Existing (Post-service) Condition](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/agg#aggravationofanexistingpostservicecondition)  \n\u2074 [Aggravation of a Preexisting (Pre-service) Condition](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/agg#aggravationofapreexistingpreservicecondition)  \n\u2075 [Rating Aggravated Conditions](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/agg#ratingaggravatedconditions)",

It is important to file your appeal within one year of your claim's decision date if you want to keep your effective date (back pay). Filing an appeal invites the VA to review your file, and if a Clear and Unmistakable Error (CUE) is found or your condition has improved, the VA may adjust your rating accordingly.\n\nIf you choose to appeal to the Board of Veterans Appeals (BVA), you can submit your appeal online, via your VSO or lawyer, by fax, or by mail. The contact details for submitting by fax or mail are:\n\n- Fax: 844-678-8979\n- Mail: Board of Veterans' Appeals, P.O. Box 27063, Washington, DC 20038\n\nIf your appeal is denied again, you may try another eligible option. If you disagree with a BVA decision and have new and relevant evidence, you can file a Supplemental Claim or appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims.\n\nRemember, you cannot file multiple appeals for the same issue simultaneously without withdrawing the current appeal first.\n\nFor checking the status of your appeal, you can visit VA.gov, call 1 (800) 827-1000, or make a VERA appointment.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n\u00b9 [Filing an Appeal](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals#filinganappeal)  \n\u00b2 [Filing an Appeal - FAQ](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals#faq)  \n\u00b3 [Submitting to BVA](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals)",

        "success": true,
        "content": "A Higher-Level Review (HLR) is an entirely new review of your VA claim conducted by a more experienced, senior rater known as a Decision Review Officer (DRO). This review involves re-examining the existing evidence of record without considering any new evidence submitted after the original decision was made. The DRO has the authority to issue a \"difference of opinion,\" meaning they can weigh the evidence differently than the previous rater, potentially resulting in a favorable outcome for the veteran. However, this difference of opinion cannot lead to a negative outcome for the veteran. If there were any Clear and Unmistakable Errors (CUEs) in the prior decision, these can be corrected even if the correction results in a negative outcome, provided proper due notice is given.\n\nKey points about Higher-Level Review include:\n\n- New evidence received after the decision cannot be considered.\n- Intents to file do not apply to HLRs.\n- Veterans cannot file back-to-back HLRs but can alternate between HLRs and supplemental claims.\n- Veterans cannot request an HLR after a Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA) denial.\n- The HLR must be submitted within one year of the claim's decision.\n\nIf the senior rater identifies any Duty to Assist (DTA) errors during the HLR, they will issue a rating decision and close the HLR, noting the errors. These errors will be addressed in a subsequent supplemental claim, which allows new and relevant evidence to be submitted and is decided by non-DRO raters.\n\nOverall, the HLR is a faster, evidence-based review process focused on re-evaluating the existing record by a more experienced adjudicator without introducing new evidence or starting a new claim process\u00b3.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Higher-Level Review (HLR 20-0996)](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-20-0996-ARE.pdf)  \n\u00b2 [Higher-Level Review (Part 2) - (appeals)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals)  \n\u00b3 [Higher-Level Review (Part 1) - (appeals)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals)",

The review is conducted by Veterans Law Judges who are not bound by VA Central Office policy decisions and have the authority to issue grants that VA raters cannot.

Veterans must submit their appeal to the BVA within one year of their claim's decision, and they cannot request a BVA appeal after receiving a BVA decision for the same claimed item consecutively. The BVA offers three appeal lanes for veterans to choose from: Direct Review, Evidence Submission, and Hearing.

        "content": "A combined rating is the overall disability rating assigned by the VA when a veteran has multiple service-connected conditions. Instead of simply adding the individual ratings together, the VA uses a specific combined ratings table to calculate the total combined rating. This method accounts for the fact that a veteran cannot be more than 100% disabled and that the impact of multiple disabilities is not purely additive.\n\nFor example, if a veteran has a 30% rating for one condition and a 10% rating for another, the combined rating is not 40%, but rather 37% according to the combined ratings table. Additionally, if the veteran has bilateral disabilities (affecting both sides of the body), a bilateral factor of 10% is applied to the combined rating of those bilateral conditions, increasing the overall combined rating further. The final combined rating is rounded to the nearest whole number and cannot exceed 100%\u00b9 \u2076 \u2077.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [VA Math - Combined Ratings Calculation - Legal References](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vamath#references)  \n\u2076 [Bilateral Factor (Part 2) - (rating_calculation)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vamath#combined)  \n\u2077 [Bilateral Factor (Part 2) - (rating_calculation)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vamath#combined)",

        "content": "VA math, or the VA combined ratings calculation, is the method used by the Department of Veterans Affairs to combine multiple disability ratings into a single overall disability rating. This process is not a simple addition of percentages but uses a specific combined ratings table as outlined in 38 CFR \u00a7 4.25. The combined rating reflects the overall level of disability and determines compensation.\n\nKey points about VA math include:\n\n- The combined rating is calculated using a combined ratings table, not by adding percentages directly. This ensures the total rating does not exceed 100% inappropriately.  \n- If a veteran has disabilities affecting both sides of the body (bilateral disabilities), a bilateral factor may be applied to increase the combined rating slightly. The application of the bilateral factor is governed by 38 CFR \u00a7 4.26 and specific VA guidelines.  \n- Veterans can check if their conditions have been given the bilateral factor by reviewing their VA codesheet.  \n- The maximum combined rating is 100%, but under certain circumstances, veterans may receive Special Monthly Compensation (SMC), which can result in payments higher than the 100% rate.  \n\nFor detailed legal references and guidance, the combined ratings table and bilateral factor rules are found in the Code of Federal Regulations and VA manuals cited in the VA Math references\u00b9.  \n\n**Sources:**  \n\u00b9 [VA Math - Combined Ratings Calculation - Legal References](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vamath#references)  \n\u00b2 [VA Math - Combined Ratings Calculation - FAQ](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vamath#faq)  \n\u2074 [VA Math - Combined Ratings Calculation - FAQ](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vamath#faq)",

Additionally, if you are unable to maintain substantially gainful employment due to your service-connected disabilities, you may qualify for Total Disability based on Individual Unemployability (TDIU), which is considered a 100% rating for benefits purposes even if your combined rating is less than 100%\u00b9.\n\nYou can also receive a temporary 100% rating during hospitalization for certain conditions if the medical evidence supports it, showing the condition causing hospitalization and the length of stay\u2077.\n\nIf you have non-static conditions (conditions that may improve or worsen), you can still be considered permanently and totally disabled (P&T) if the conditions that make up your 100% rating or TDIU are static (not expected to improve)\u2074. For example, active cancer is considered a non-static condition but does not affect the P&T status if the rest of your rating is static\u00b3\u2074.\n\nTo check if you are already rated P&T, you can view your VA Benefit Summary letter on va.gov, which will state if you are considered totally and permanently disabled due to your service-connected disabilities\u2075.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Permanent and Total (P&T) Disability - FAQ](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/pnt#faq)  \n\u00b3 [Permanent and Total (P&T) Disability - FAQ](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/pnt#faq)  \n\u2074 [Permanent and Total (P&T) Disability - FAQ](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/pnt#faq)  \n\u2075 [Permanent and Total (P&T) Disability - FAQ](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/pnt#faq)  \n\u2077 [Filing for Temporary 100%](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/temp100)",

        "content": "The difference between schedular and TDIU (Total Disability Individual Unemployability) lies primarily in how the disability rating is determined and the Veteran's ability to work:\n\n- **Schedular Rating**: This is the disability rating assigned based on the VA's rating schedule for specific disabilities. It reflects the average impairment in earning capacity caused by the service-connected condition(s) as outlined in the rating criteria.\n\n- **TDIU (Total Disability Individual Unemployability)**: This is a special type of rating granted when a Veteran's service-connected disabilities, regardless of their combined schedular rating, prevent them from securing or maintaining substantially gainful employment. To qualify for TDIU, the Veteran must have at least one service-connected disability rated at 60% or higher and be unable to hold a steady job due to their disabilities. Marginal or odd jobs do not disqualify a Veteran from TDIU. TDIU essentially compensates the Veteran at the 100% disability rate based on unemployability rather than the schedular rating alone\u00b9\u2077.\n\nIn summary, schedular ratings are based on medical impairment percentages, while TDIU is based on the Veteran's inability to work due to service-connected disabilities, potentially granting a 100% rating even if the combined schedular rating is less than 100%\u00b9 \u2077.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Unemployability - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/IU)  \n\u2077 [50% - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/IU)",

This confinement must be permanent or expected to continue throughout the veteran's lifetime. The veteran may leave occasionally for medical appointments or other necessary trips, but these do not disqualify housebound status. Typically, the veteran should have service-connected disabilities that combine to at least 100% to meet this requirement. If institutionalized, the confinement applies to the ward or clinical areas of the institution.\n\nThere is also a statutory housebound status, which applies when a veteran has a single 100% disability rating plus a separate single 60% rating, or multiple ratings that combine to at least 60%. However, a single disease process that combines separate evaluations to 100% does not count as a singular 100% rating for this purpose\u00b2.\n\nHousebound status can result in eligibility for Special Monthly Compensation (SMC S) or increased VA Pension benefits, depending on whether the condition is service-connected or non-service-connected.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [SMC S (Housebound)/(Statutory Housebound)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/smc#smcshouseboundstatutoryhousebound)  \n\u00b2 [Housebound - Special Monthly Pension - (pension)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/pension-housebound#houseboundspecialmonthlypension)",

It can be awarded as part of an increased VA Pension for veterans with non-service connected conditions, or as Special Monthly Compensation (SMC) for those with service-connected disabilities.\n\nSpecifically, Aid and Attendance under SMC L is awarded to veterans who meet one or more of the following criteria:\n\n- Anatomical loss or loss of use of both feet;\n- Anatomical loss or loss of use of one hand and one foot;\n- Loss of sight or blindness in both eyes;\n- Permanently bedridden; or\n- Need daily help with basic needs such as eating, dressing, and bathing.\n\nAdditionally, a veteran may qualify if their disability (mental or physical) requires another person to regularly help prevent them from harming themselves or others.\n\nAn important policy note is that the service-connected disabilities causing the need for Aid and Attendance generally must be from a single disease process that combines to a 100% rating or has an evaluation of 100%. If this is not met, an advisory opinion from VA Central Office is required, which can be difficult to obtain favorably. Veterans denied Aid and Attendance may appeal to the Board of Veterans Appeals (BVA)\u00b9\u00b3.\n\nAid and Attendance is distinct from non-service connected Aid and Attendance, which is part of an increased VA Pension benefit, whereas service-connected Aid and Attendance is part of Special Monthly Compensation (SMC) benefits\u00b9.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Aid and Attendance (Pension)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/pension-aa#aidandattendancepension)  \n\u00b3 [SMC L (Aid and Attendance)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/smc#smclaidandattendance)",

The VA must show continuous improvement, typically requiring more than one exam showing sustained improvement before proposing a reduction\u00b2\u00b3.\n\n- There are exceptions, such as conditions rated based on lab results (e.g., kidney or lung function), where an improvement shown by a single lab test may lead to a reduction if you filed an increase claim and the new test confirms improvement\u00b2\u00b3.\n\n- Note that this 5-year protection does not reset after 5 years; improvements shown later can still lead to reductions\u00b2\u00b3.\n\nIn summary, your rating can be reduced if there is a clear error or sustained improvement in your condition, but protections exist to prevent reductions based on a single exam after 5 years of a stable rating.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Filing an Appeal - FAQ](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals#faq)  \n\u00b2 [5 Years - Reductions (38 CFR 3.344) - (references)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/ratingsindex#protection)  \n\u00b3 [5 Years - Reductions (38 CFR 3.344) - (references)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/ears)",

A report has been generated and someone will review this.\n\nA protected rating refers to a VA disability rating that cannot be reduced for a certain period of time after it has been assigned or increased. Specifically:\n\n- When a veteran's rating is increased, the previous rating percentage may have protection for 5, 10, or 20 years.\n- The 5-year protection applies only to the original rating percentage before the increase, not the newly increased rating.\n- For example, if a veteran had a 10% rating for 10 years and then it was increased to 30%, the 10% rating retains its 5-year protection, but the new 30% rating does not have that 5-year protection initially.\n- The 20-year protection applies only to the original rating that has been held for 20 years, not the increased rating.\n- This means a veteran's rating is \"protected\" from reduction for a set period, depending on how long the rating has been held, but this protection applies differently to original and increased ratings.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Example Involving Increase - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/ratingsindex#protection)  \n\u00b2 [Example Involving Increase - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/ears)",

        "content": "A static rating refers to a service-connected disability rating that is not subject to regular future evaluations or reexaminations by the VA. These conditions are considered stable and unlikely to improve or worsen, so their rating remains fixed unless there is a clear error or new evidence. In contrast, dynamic ratings are those that can be reevaluated over time because the condition may improve or worsen, affecting the disability percentage.\n\nMost conditions rated by the VA are now made static from the outset, meaning they do not require ongoing reevaluation. Veterans can check which of their conditions are static or dynamic online or by reviewing their C-File code sheet. Static conditions are important because they factor into whether a veteran can be granted permanent and total (P&T) disability status, which generally requires that the combined rating be based on static conditions.\n\nIn summary:\n\n- **Static ratings:** Conditions not subject to regular future evaluations; rating remains fixed unless corrected for error or new evidence\u00b9\u00b3.\n- **Dynamic ratings:** Conditions that can be reevaluated over time due to potential changes in severity\u00b9.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Static vs Dynamic Ratings - FAQ](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/static-check#faq)  \n\u00b3 [Static vs Dynamic Ratings - (rating_info)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/static-check#staticvsdynamicratings)",

However, the month of your effective date is **not** paid out.\n- VA pays benefits in arrears, meaning payments are made at the end of the month.\n- If you believe your back pay amount is incorrect after accounting for these factors, you can call the VA at 1-800-827-1000 and request an audit to review your payments.\n- Unexpected money you receive may be back pay resulting from a positive claim decision or from an audit that found you were underpaid.\n\nSo, to get back pay, you must have a claim with an established effective date, and if payments seem off, you can request a VA audit to correct it.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [VA Money Matters and Back Pay - FAQ](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/money#faq)  \n\u00b2 [VA Money Matters and Back Pay - FAQ](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/money#faq)",

Our internal confidence score is **47.4%** for this response - please verify the answer with your own due diligence. A report has been generated and someone will review this.\n\nThe 5 year rule refers to the protection a Veteran has against reduction of their disability rating based on a single Compensation & Pension (C&P) exam showing improvement. Specifically:\n\n- A Veteran's rating generally cannot be reduced based on just one exam that shows improvement if the evaluation has been held for at least 5 continuous years.\n- Continuous improvement must be shown, meaning it usually requires more than one exam showing the condition is still improved before the VA will issue a proposal for reduction.\n- If the reduction would lower the combined evaluation, the Veteran will receive a proposal for reduction; otherwise, the condition may be reduced without notice.\n- This protection does not reset after 5 years. For example, if an exam shows improvement at year 6 and another at year 16, the VA can still seek to reduce the rating based on those improvements.\n- There are exceptions, such as conditions rated based on lab results (e.g., kidney or lung function), where a single improved lab result can lead to reduction, especially if the Veteran filed an increase claim for that condition.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [5 Years - Reductions (38 CFR 3.344)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/ratingsindex#protection)  \n\u00b2 [5 Years - Reductions (38 CFR 3.344)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/ears)",

        "content": "PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) is rated by the VA based on the severity of the totality of a Veteran's mental health symptoms, not on the specific diagnosis itself. This means that PTSD is rated similarly to other mental disorders, with a single rating assigned based on symptom severity regardless of the number of diagnoses a Veteran has\u00b9.\n\nFor service-connection, PTSD requires an in-service stressor, which can include a wide range of traumatic events such as combat, assault, military sexual trauma, environmental disasters, and others. The Veteran's lay testimony may sometimes establish the occurrence of an in-service stressor under specific conditions, especially if supported by a VA psychiatrist or psychologist\u00b2\u00b3.\n\nThe VA rates mental disorders, including PTSD, by evaluating symptoms such as occupational and social impairment, reliability and productivity, panic attacks, memory impairment, judgment, mood disturbances, and social relationships. For example, a 50% rating corresponds to occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity due to symptoms like panic attacks more than once a week, difficulty understanding complex commands, impaired judgment, and disturbances of motivation and mood\u2074.\n\nAdditionally, PTSD and TBI (Traumatic Brain Injury) symptoms often overlap, and the VA may lump the ratings together unless the symptoms can be clearly separated, in which case separate ratings may be assigned\u2075.\n\nThe rating decision is based on all evidence submitted, including C&P exam reports, DBQs, nexus letters, buddy letters, personal statements, and treatment notes. The rating percentage assigned reflects the overall severity of symptoms, not just isolated symptoms\u2076.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n\u00b9 [Mental Disorder Ratings - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)  \n\u00b2 [PTSD Service-Connection - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)  \n\u00b3 [3.

        "content": "Yes, you can get service-connected for PTSD without combat. PTSD service-connection requires an in-service stressor, but this stressor does not have to be related to direct combat exposure. Veterans may develop PTSD from a variety of non-combat stressors such as:\n\n- Aircraft crashes  \n- Assault or battery  \n- Environmental disasters (earthquakes, fires, floods, etc.)  \n- Harassment or military sexual trauma (MST) including sexual assault or harassment  \n- Serving as a drone aircraft crew member  \n- Serving in mortuary affairs  \n- Stalking  \n- Training accidents  \n- Vehicular crashes  \n\nAdditionally, fear of hostile enemy forces is also recognized as a stressor, even if the Veteran was not in direct combat, but this does not include anticipation of future deployment or learning of a death away from the Veteran in a hostile location\u00b9.\n\nNon-combat stressors must be corroborated with credible supporting evidence, as a Veteran\u2019s lay statement alone is generally insufficient for verification of the stressor unless it meets specific criteria such as combat, fear of hostile military or terrorist activity, or duties as a drone aircraft crew member confirmed by a VA psychiatrist or psychologist\u00b2\u00b3\u2075.\n\nTherefore, service connection for PTSD is possible without combat if the Veteran can establish an in-service stressor consistent with the circumstances of their service and supported by evidence.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [PTSD Service-Connection - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)  \n\u00b2 [3.

        "content": "\u26a0\ufe0f **Note:** Some specific numbers in this response could not be verified against my sources. Please verify key statistics with official VA documentation.\n\nAnxiety is rated under the general rating formula for mental disorders, which assesses the severity of symptoms and their impact on occupational and social impairment. The rating levels are based on the degree of impairment caused by symptoms such as panic attacks, anxiety, mood changes, and social functioning.\n\nHere are the key rating levels for anxiety:\n\n- **10% Rating**: Occupational and social impairment due to mild or transient symptoms which decrease work efficiency and ability to perform occupational tasks only during periods of significant stress, or symptoms controlled by continuous medication. Symptoms include mild anxiety, depression, or other mood changes; rare mild panic attacks; occasional sleep disturbances. The veteran is always able to care for themselves and rarely has problems working or in social relationships\u00b9\u2074.\n\n- **30% Rating**: Occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks. Symptoms include depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, panic attacks (weekly or less often), chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss. The veteran can usually care for themselves but may occasionally be hospitalized, may occasionally be unable to work properly, and social relationships may be strained\u00b9\u2076.\n\n- **50% Rating**: Occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity due to symptoms such as panic attacks more than once a week, difficulty understanding complex commands, impaired judgment, disturbances of mood, and difficulty maintaining effective work and social relationships. The veteran is mostly able to care for themselves but hygiene may not always be maintained, can work but may have difficulty staying employed long-term, and social relationships may be short-lived\u00b9\u2077.\n\n- **70% and 100% Ratings**: These represent more severe occupational and social impairment with symptoms such as near-continuous panic or depression, suicidal ideation, gross impairment in thought processes, persistent danger of hurting self or others, and inability to perform activities of daily living. These higher ratings indicate severe disability but specific anxiety-related criteria are detailed under the general mental disorders rating formula\u00b9\u00b3.\n\nThe veteran's formal diagnosis (e.g., generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder) is not as important as the severity of symptoms when determining the rating. A single rating covers all mental health diagnoses combined\u00b9\u2075.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Anxiety Disorders - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)  \n\u00b3 [General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders - (rating_criteria)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental#generalratingformulaformentaldisorders)  \n\u2074 [10% - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)  \n\u2076 [30% - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)  \n\u2077 [50% - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)  \n\u2075 [Mental Disorder Ratings - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)",

The rating depends on how much the symptoms affect the veteran's ability to function in daily life, work, and social relationships.\n\nThe ratings are as follows:\n\n- **100% rating**: Total occupational and social impairment due to symptoms such as gross impairment in thought processes, persistent delusions or hallucinations, grossly inappropriate behavior, persistent danger of hurting self or others, intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living, disorientation, or memory loss of close relatives or own identity.\n\n- **70% rating**: Occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood. Symptoms may include suicidal ideation, obsessional rituals interfering with routine activities, illogical or obscure speech, near-continuous panic or depression affecting function, impaired impulse control, spatial disorientation, neglect of hygiene, difficulty adapting to stress, and inability to maintain effective relationships.\n\n- **50% rating**: Occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity due to symptoms such as flattened affect, stereotyped speech, panic attacks more than once a week, difficulty understanding complex commands, impaired memory, impaired judgment and abstract thinking, disturbances of mood and motivation, and difficulty establishing and maintaining work and social relationships. The veteran is mostly able to care for themselves but may have hygiene issues and difficulty maintaining employment or relationships.\n\n- Lower ratings (not fully detailed in the context) would correspond to less severe symptoms and impairment.\n\nImportantly, the rating is based on the totality and severity of symptoms, not the diagnosis of depression itself. A veteran with depression can receive the same rating as one with PTSD or other mental disorders if the severity of symptoms is similar\u00b3.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental#generalratingformulaformentaldisorders)  \n\u00b2 [Mental Disorder Ratings](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)  \n\u00b3 [50%](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)",

It can range from mild to total impairment and affects areas such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, mood, and social interactions.\n\n- At 10% rating level, occupational and social impairment is due to mild or transient symptoms that decrease work efficiency and ability to perform occupational tasks only during periods of significant stress. Symptoms are mild and may be controlled by medication, with occasional social issues and rare problems at work\u00b9.\n\n- At 100% rating level, occupational and social impairment is total, characterized by gross impairment in thought processes or communication, persistent delusions or hallucinations, grossly inappropriate behavior, persistent danger of hurting self or others, inability to perform daily living activities, disorientation, and severe memory loss. The veteran is unable to care for themselves, unable to work, and has severely impaired social relationships\u00b3.\n\n- The general rating formula describes occupational and social impairment as deficiencies in most areas such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood due to symptoms like suicidal ideation, panic or depression affecting function, impaired impulse control, neglect of hygiene, difficulty adapting to stress, and inability to maintain relationships\u00b9.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [10% - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)\n\u00b2 [General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders - (rating_criteria)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental#generalratingformulaformentaldisorders)\n\u00b3 [100% - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)",

A report has been generated and someone will review this.\n\nThe context provided does not explicitly define what a \"stressor statement\" is. However, it does mention that claims for service connection of PTSD require a standard claim form, and stressors related to PTSD claims can be researched based on information found in VA Form 21-0781, lay statements, military records, or medical records/statements made to an examiner. This implies that a stressor statement could be a lay statement or other documentation describing the in-service stressor experienced by the Veteran, which helps establish the occurrence of the stressor for PTSD claims\u00b9.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [3.

Here are the key ways to prove your PTSD stressor:\n\n- Submit a standard claim form for service connection of PTSD.\n- Provide evidence of the stressor through:\n  - VA Form 21-0781 (Supporting Statements for Service Connection for PTSD).\n  - Lay statements or personal testimony describing the stressor.\n  - Military records that show combat participation, service in areas consistent with hostile military or terrorist activity, or other relevant service circumstances.\n  - Medical records or statements made to examiners that document the stressor or PTSD diagnosis.\n- In some cases, such as combat or fear-based stressors, the VA may order examinations without specific stressor details, but if PTSD is diagnosed, the stressor must be verified as consistent with service places and circumstances.\n- A Veteran\u2019s lay testimony alone may establish an in-service stressor if:\n  - PTSD was diagnosed in service and the stressor is related to that service, or\n  - The stressor is related to combat engagement, experience as a prisoner of war, or fear of hostile military or terrorist activity, and a VA psychiatrist or psychologist confirms the stressor supports the PTSD diagnosis and symptoms.\n- The stressor must be consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of service or the places and types of service.\n- The VA will review various types of evidence to verify the stressor, including:\n  - After action reports, buddy letters, combat awards on your DD-214, command chronologies, diaries, daily staff journals, personal statements, police or insurance reports, private medical records, service treatment records, unit histories, and more.\n\nThis evidence helps corroborate the occurrence of the stressor during your service and supports your PTSD claim\u00b3\u2075.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [3.

The 70% rating implies a higher level of disability and symptom severity than 50%, but exact criteria are not provided in the sources.\n\nTherefore, the key difference is that 50% rating reflects moderate symptoms with some functional impairment but the ability to work and care for oneself with difficulty, while 70% rating indicates more severe symptoms and impairment, though the exact criteria for 70% are not given in the provided context.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n\u00b9 [50% - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)  \n\u2077 [TBI Rating Example - (rating_table)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/TBI)",

A Veteran receives a single rating for their mental health condition(s), regardless of the number of diagnoses they have, except in the case of an eating disorder, which is rated separately from other mental health disorders\u00b9\u00b3.\n\nThe rating is determined by a rater who reviews all submitted evidence, including Compensation & Pension (C&P) exam reports, Disability Benefits Questionnaires (DBQs), nexus letters, buddy statements, personal statements, supporting statements for PTSD claims, private and VA treatment notes, and Vet Center notes (with permission). The rater assigns a rating percentage that most closely matches the overall severity of the Veteran's symptoms, considering the totality of evidence rather than isolated symptoms\u00b2.\n\nFor example, a 50% rating corresponds to occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity due to symptoms such as flattened affect, panic attacks more than once a week, impaired judgment, and difficulty maintaining effective work and social relationships. The Veteran may be mostly able to care for themselves but may have difficulty sustaining employment and forming lasting relationships\u2074.\n\nVeterans are encouraged to be completely honest during their C&P examination without exaggerating or fabricating symptoms, as the rating depends on an accurate assessment of symptom severity\u00b3.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n\u00b9 [Mental Disorder Ratings - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)  \n\u00b2 [How a Rater Decides - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/cnp)  \n\u00b3 [Mental Disorders - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)  \n\u2074 [50% - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)",

        "success": true,
        "content": "Hearing loss is rated by the VA using a combination of puretone audiometry and speech discrimination test results for both ears together, not individually. The process involves the following steps:\n\n- The audiologist conducts two tests:\n  - Puretone audiometry test: measures hearing threshold levels at various frequencies.\n  - Speech discrimination test: measures the ability to understand spoken words, scored as a percentage.\n\n- Each ear's results are assigned a Roman numeral (I through XI) based on a table that combines puretone threshold averages and speech discrimination percentages. Higher numerals indicate worse hearing loss.\n\n- Using the Roman numerals for the worst ear and the best ear, a rating table is applied to determine the overall disability rating percentage. The rating ranges from 0% to 100%, with specific percentages assigned based on the combination of hearing loss severity in both ears.\n\n- To qualify for any rating (above 0%), the hearing loss must meet at least one of these criteria:\n  - Auditory threshold of 40 decibels or greater at any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz.\n  - Auditory thresholds of 26 decibels or greater at at least three of those frequencies.\n  - Speech recognition scores less than 94 percent.\n\n- If one ear is service-connected and the other is not, the VA may consider the non-service-connected ear as service-connected for rating purposes if:\n  - The non-service-connected ear was not due to willful misconduct.\n  - The non-service-connected ear has hearing loss for VA purposes.\n  - The service-connected ear rates at least 10% by itself.\n\n- If only puretone testing was done, a separate puretone-only table is used to assign the Roman numeral for each ear.\n\n- If an ear is not service-connected, it is considered to be in perfect working order (100%) for rating purposes unless special conditions apply.\n\n- Hearing aids must be removed before testing.\n\nThis combined approach ensures the rating reflects the overall impact of hearing loss on both ears, not just one ear individually\u00b3.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Rating Table - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/ears)  \n\u00b2 [DC 6100 - Hearing Loss - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/ears#6100)  \n\u00b3 [Puretone and Speech Discrimination Table - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/ears)",

The rating considers the need for insulin, a restricted diet, and regulation of activities, especially when diabetes has caused episodes of ketoacidosis resulting in hospitalization. Use of non-insulin injectable medications is treated as oral hypoglycemic agents and not equivalent to insulin treatment for rating purposes.\n\nAdditionally, diabetes may be considered a presumptive condition if diagnosed within one year of separation and warrants at least a 10% evaluation, or if the veteran was exposed to Agent Orange and the severity ever warranted at least a 10% evaluation.\n\nRegulation of activities means avoiding strenuous activity to prevent hypoglycemic episodes, but voluntary avoidance or prescribed exercise alone does not meet the criteria for rating purposes\u00b9.\n\nFor diabetic retinopathy, which is damage to the retina caused by diabetes, the rating is based on the Visual Impairment Rating System or on Incapacitating Episodes, whichever gives the highest rating\u00b2.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [DC 7913 - Diabetes Mellitus - (rating_table)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/endsystem#7913)  \n\u00b2 [DC 6040 - Diabetic Retinopathy - (condition_definition)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/eyes#6040)",

        "success": true,
        "content": "Scars are rated by the VA based on several factors including their location, size, characteristics, and associated symptoms such as pain or instability. The rating process involves different diagnostic codes depending on the type and location of the scars:\n\n- **Scars NOT involving the head, face, or neck** are divided into six body areas (torso front, back, left arm, right arm, left leg, right leg). Each area can be rated separately unless combining scar sizes from all areas results in a higher rating. Deep and superficial scars in the same area receive separate ratings. If scars cause range of motion issues, a separate rating for that impairment can be granted. Bilateral factor consideration applies unless the rating is less than 10% or specific to head, face, or neck scars\u00b9.\n\n- **Painful or unstable scars (DC 7804)**: If scars are painful when touched (self-reports are insufficient) or unstable (frequent loss of skin covering), the veteran can receive a rating for the scar plus an additional 10% if at least one scar is both painful and unstable. Ratings are 10% for 1-2 scars, 20% for 3-4 scars, and 30% for 5 or more scars\u00b2.\n\n- **General skin conditions (including scars)** are rated based on lesion coverage and treatment requirements. Ratings range from 0% (lesions cover less than 5% of the body or require only topical treatment) to 60% (lesions cover more than 40% of the body or require continuous systemic therapy)\u00b3.\n\n- **Scars involving the head, face, or neck (DC 7800)** are rated based on visible or palpable disfigurement, including scar length, width, attachment to underlying tissue, abnormal skin color or texture, and loss of underlying soft tissue. Multiple scars cannot be combined to meet width requirements. Separate ratings can be given for nerve damage or loss of eye/ear associated with the scars\u2075.\n\n- **Superficial scars (DC 7802)** affect only the skin and not underlying tissues. A 10% rating is given if superficial scars cover 144 square inches (929 cm\u00b2) or more\u2077.\n\n- **All other scars (DC 7805)** are rated under the diagnostic code that best captures the impairment\u2074.\n\nIn summary, scars are rated based on their location, size, depth, pain or instability, and associated functional impairments, with specific diagnostic codes and criteria applied accordingly.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Scars NOT Involving the Head, Face, or Neck](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/skin)  \n\u00b2 [DC 7804 - Painful or Unstable Scars](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/skin#7804)  \n\u00b3 [General Rating Formula For The Skin](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/skin)  \n\u2074 [DC 7805 - All other Scars](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/skin#7805)  \n\u2075 [DC 7800 - Scars and Disfigurement Involving the Head, Face, or Neck](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/skin#7800)  \n\u2077 [DC 7802 - Superficial Scars](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/skin#7802)",

A 10% evaluation is appropriate even if there is no evidence of esophageal stricture(s) but daily medication is required to control other symptoms associated with GERD.\n- 30% rating: Esophageal stricture(s) that cause difficulty swallowing requiring dilation no more than 2 times a year.\n- 50% rating: Recurrent or refractory esophageal stricture(s) causing difficulty swallowing (details truncated in source).\n\nImportant notes:\n- GERD cannot be rated separately from difficulty swallowing (DC 7203).\n- The condition must be medically documented, and if strictures are the basis, documented by barium swallow, CT scan, or esophagogastroduodenoscopy.\n- GERD is not considered a functional gastrointestinal disorder.\n- The VA may award evaluations even if all symptoms are not present, based on 38 CFR 4.7.\n\nIn summary, GERD ratings depend largely on the presence and severity of esophageal strictures and the need for daily medication or dilation procedures to control symptoms\u00b9\u00b3\u00b2.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [DC 7206 - Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease - (rating_table)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/digsystem#7206)  \n\u00b2 [Rating Schedule for the Digestive System - (references)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/ratingsindex)  \n\u00b3 [DC 7203 - Difficulty Swallowing - (rating_table)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/digsystem#7203)",

The VA evaluates the Veteran in each of these areas but assigns only one singular TBI rating based on the area with the highest level of impairment, unless it is more beneficial to separate symptoms into individual ratings. However, a Veteran will not receive 10 individual ratings for TBI symptoms\u00b9.\n\nIf the examiner diagnoses a TBI but notes no residual symptoms, a 0% rating is granted if service-connection is warranted\u00b9.\n\nAdditionally, the severity of the TBI itself is categorized as mild, moderate, or severe based on criteria such as brain imaging results, duration of loss of consciousness, disorientation, amnesia, and Glasgow Coma Scale scores. Meeting just one criterion in a category qualifies the TBI for that severity level\u00b3.\n\nThere is also an important consideration regarding overlapping symptoms with PTSD. If the examiner cannot separate TBI symptoms from PTSD symptoms, the ratings may be lumped together. However, if the symptoms can be clearly separated by a specialist, the Veteran can receive separate ratings for TBI and PTSD\u2075.\n\nFinally, the VA is prohibited from assigning multiple ratings for the same symptoms (pyramiding), so care is taken to avoid rating the same symptom twice, even if it appears under different conditions such as vertigo or headaches\u2076.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [How TBI is Rated](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/TBI)\n\u00b3 [Severity of TBI](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/TBI)\n\u2075 [PTSD & TBI](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)\n\u2076 [Pyramiding](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals)",

        "content": "Aggravation of a secondary condition refers to a situation where a service-connected condition worsens an existing condition that developed after service (a post-service condition). For the VA to consider this aggravation, it must establish two things:\n\n- The level of severity of the condition before aggravation.\n- The level of severity of the condition after aggravation.\n\nYou must provide medical evidence showing the severity of the condition before aggravation or as soon as possible after aggravation but before the current severity is documented. The VA will then obtain a medical opinion to determine if the service-connected condition worsened the existing condition beyond its natural progression at least as likely as not. If the opinion is favorable, the condition can be service-connected due to aggravation\u00b9.\n\nThere are two types of service-connection by aggravation:\n\n1. Aggravation of a preexisting (pre-service) condition by military service.\n2. Aggravation of an existing (post-service) condition by a service-connected condition\u00b2.\n\nIn the context of secondary conditions, these are conditions that result from or are caused by a service-connected disability.

Veterans who were exposed to Agent Orange and developed these diseases within one year of last exposure are eligible for presumptive service connection for these conditions, meaning they do not have to prove the disease was caused by their service.\n\nThe specific presumptive diseases related to Agent Orange exposure are:\n\n- Chloracne or other acneform disease consistent with chloracne\n- Early-onset peripheral neuropathy\n- Porphyria cutanea tarda\n\nThese conditions must have reached at least 10% severity within one year of the last possible exposure to Agent Orange to qualify for presumptive status\u00b9.\n\nAdditionally, eligibility for presumptive status depends on where and when the Veteran served, including service in locations such as the Republic of Vietnam, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Guam, American Samoa, Korean DMZ, Johnston Atoll, and service on certain Air Force units with C-123 aircraft exposed to Agent Orange during specific time frames\u00b2.\n\nIf a Veteran can show that exposure was as likely as not in certain non-presumptive locations where Agent Orange was stored, destroyed, or tested, the VA may concede exposure and consider presumptive status\u00b3.\n\nIn summary, Agent Orange presumptive means the VA presumes that certain diseases diagnosed in Veterans who served in specific locations and time periods were caused by exposure to Agent Orange, simplifying the process for obtaining disability benefits for those conditions.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Presumptive Diseases - (presumptive)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/agentorange#presumptivediseases)  \n\u00b2 [Eligibility - (presumptive)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/agentorange#eligibility)  \n\u00b3 [Eligibility (Part 2) - (eligibility)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/agentorange#eligibility)",

This means you do not have to prove the exposure caused your condition; you only need to show that you meet the service criteria for the presumption\u00b9.\n\nAdditionally, the VA offers toxic exposure screenings at VA health facilities. These screenings ask about your potential exposure to hazards such as burn pits, Agent Orange, radiation, and other environmental hazards during your service. The screening can help identify if you have been exposed and inform you about benefits and clinical resources you may need\u00b3.\n\nIn summary:\n- For presumptive conditions, prove you meet the service requirements for the presumption (no need to prove causation)\u00b9.\n- You can get a toxic exposure screening at VA health facilities to document potential exposures\u00b3.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [What does it mean to have a presumptive condition for toxic exposure?](https://www.va.gov/resources/the-pact-act-and-your-va-benefits/#whatdoesitmeantohaveapresumptiveconditionfortoxicexposure)  \n\u00b3 [Toxic exposure screenings](https://www.va.gov/resources/the-pact-act-and-your-va-benefits/#toxicexposurescreenings)",

        "content": "The GI Bill provides education benefits to veterans through different programs, mainly Chapter 30 (Montgomery GI Bill - Active Duty) and Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill).\n\n**Chapter 30 (Montgomery GI Bill - Active Duty):**\n- Provides up to 36 months of a monthly stipend.\n- Benefits are generally payable for 10 years following release from honorable active service.\n- Can be used for college degrees, certificate programs, technical or vocational courses, flight training, apprenticeships, on-the-job training, licensing and certification tests, entrepreneurship training, certain entrance exams, and correspondence courses.\n- Includes options like the $600 Buy-Up Program, where servicemembers can contribute up to $600 while on active duty to receive increased monthly benefits.\n- May include a \"kicker\" (Branch College Fund) for veterans in critical shortage MOS, adding up to $950 a month.\n- Eligibility requires honorable discharge, a high school diploma or GED (or in some cases 12 college credit hours), and meeting specific service criteria\u00b9\u2074\u2075.\n\n**Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill):**\n- Provides up to 36 months of education benefits for service after September 10, 2001.\n- Covers full tuition and mandatory fees paid directly to public institutions; for private or foreign schools, tuition and fees are capped at a national maximum rate.\n- May include a housing allowance equal to the military BAH for an E-5 with dependents if attending at least one class in a classroom.\n- Veterans discharged before January 1, 2013, have 15 years to use this benefit; no time limit if discharged after that date.\n- Certain Reservists who lost benefits under REAP may have restored benefits under this program.\n- The Supreme Court ruled that veterans who served at least two periods qualifying for both Montgomery GI Bill and Post-9/11 GI Bill may receive additional benefits.\n- The GI Bill Comparison Tool can help determine which benefit is best for individual circumstances\u2076\u2077\u00b3.\n\nIn summary, the Montgomery GI Bill (Chapter 30) offers a monthly stipend for various education and training programs with a 10-year usage limit, while the Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33) provides broader education benefits including tuition coverage and housing allowances with more flexible usage periods depending on discharge date.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Chapter 30 (Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) - Active Duty) (Part 3)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter30montgomeryg)  \n\u00b2 [GI Bill Education Benefits - FAQ](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibill#faq)  \n\u00b3 [Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill) (Part 1)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter33post911gibi)  \n\u2074 [Chapter 30 (Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) - Active Duty) (Part 1)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter30montgomeryg)  \n\u2075 [Chapter 30 (Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) - Active Duty) - (education)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibill#chapter30montgomerygibillmgibactiveduty)  \n\u2076 [Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill) (Part 2)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter33post911gibi)  \n\u2077 [Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill) (Part 3)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter33post911gibi)",

        "content": "The Chapter 33 Post-9/11 GI Bill is an education benefit program that provides up to 36 months of education benefits to veterans who have served on Active Duty after September 10, 2001. It can be used for various educational purposes including attending institutions of higher learning, training, licensing, and certification reimbursement. Veterans attending at least one class in a classroom may be entitled to a housing allowance equal to the military Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) for an E-5 with dependents at the location of the school where the majority of classes are taken.\n\nEligibility requires an honorable period of Active Duty service on or after September 10, 2001. Veterans discharged before January 1, 2013, have 15 years to use this benefit, while those discharged after that date have no time limit to use it.\n\nThe benefits include full tuition and mandatory fees paid directly to public schools, capped tuition and fees for private or foreign schools, a books and supplies stipend up to $1,000 per year (prorated if less than full time), and potential additional payments such as a rural benefit or a kicker for critical shortage MOS enlistments. The rate of pursuit (credit load) affects how quickly the 36 months of benefits are used.\n\nPublic colleges and universities must charge veterans and dependents in-state tuition by law when using this benefit and not on Active Duty, although residency requirements may still apply and must be waived.\n\nThe program also allows for additional GI Bill benefits if a veteran served qualifying periods under both the Montgomery GI Bill and the Post-9/11 GI Bill.\n\nOverall, the Post-9/11 GI Bill is designed to support veterans in pursuing education and training after their service with comprehensive financial assistance for tuition, housing, books, and other education-related costs\u00b3\u2074\u2075\u2076.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n\u00b9 [Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill) (Part 1)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter33post911gibi)  \n\u00b2 [Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill) (Part 2)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter33post911gibi)  \n\u00b3 [Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill) (Part 3)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter33post911gibi)  \n\u2074 [Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill) (Part 5)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter33post911gibi)  \n\u2075 [Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill) (Part 7)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter33post911gibi)  \n\u2076 [Chapter 30 (Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) - Active Duty) (Part 1)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter30montgomeryg)",

        "content": "The Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) is an education benefit program for veterans who have served on active duty. It provides a monthly stipend for up to 36 months that can be used for various educational and training programs, including college degrees, certificate programs, technical or vocational courses, flight training, apprenticeships, on-the-job training, licensing and certification tests, entrepreneurship training, certain entrance examinations, and correspondence courses. Remedial, deficiency, and refresher courses may also be approved under certain circumstances.\n\nEligibility generally requires an honorable discharge, a high school diploma or GED (or in some cases 12 hours of college credit), and meeting specific service-related criteria. Benefits are typically payable for 10 years following release from honorable active service.\n\nAdditional features include a $600 Buy-Up Program, where servicemembers can contribute extra funds while on active duty to increase their monthly benefits, and a \"kicker\" or Branch College Fund, which provides additional monthly payments for veterans who joined a military occupational specialty (MOS) with a critical shortage of personnel.\n\nThe MGIB can be combined with other GI Bill benefits under certain conditions, such as serving multiple qualifying periods of service.\n\n\u00b3\u2074\u2076\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [GI Bill Education Benefits - FAQ](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibill#faq)  \n\u00b2 [Chapter 30 (Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) - Active Duty)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibill#chapter30montgomerygibillmgibactiveduty)  \n\u00b3 [Chapter 30 (Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) - Active Duty) (Part 3)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter30montgomeryg)  \n\u2074 [Chapter 30 (Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) - Active Duty) (Part 1)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter30montgomeryg)  \n\u2076 [Chapter 30 (Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) - Active Duty) (Part 2)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter30montgomeryg)",

It is a program where schools voluntarily enter into an agreement with the VA to fund tuition expenses that are not covered by the GI Bill, often for higher-cost programs or out-of-state tuition. The amount of assistance and eligibility depends on factors set by the school, such as the degree type and program. Veterans must apply for Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits first and then apply for the Yellow Ribbon Program through their school, which determines the number of students accepted and the amount of funding available\u00b9.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Reference - (education)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/yellow#reference)  \n\u00b9 [Application Process - (education)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/yellow#applicationprocess)  \n\u00b9 [Yellow Ribbon Program - FAQ - (faq)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/yellow#faq)",

        "success": true,
        "content": "Chapter 35 Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) is a VA education benefit program that provides education and training opportunities to the spouse and dependent children (including step and adopted children) of a Veteran or Servicemember who meets certain criteria. These criteria include the Veteran being permanently and totally disabled from service-connected conditions, having died in service, having died of service-connected causes, or being currently missing in action or captured in the line of duty\u00b9.\n\nThe DEA program can be used for undergraduate or graduate degrees, certificate or diploma courses from business, technical or vocational schools, apprenticeships, and on-the-job training programs. Correspondence courses are available only to spouses. The program provides up to 45 months of education or training for those who used their benefits before August 1, 2018, and 36 months for those who use the benefits on or after August 1, 2018. Each dependent gets their own individual entitlement, and the benefit is paid directly to the dependent\u00b2.\n\nEligibility requirements vary depending on when the event that made the dependent eligible occurred, with different rules for those qualifying before or after August 1, 2023. Spouses who are divorced from the Veteran lose eligibility, and children must generally be between 18 and 26 years old, with some exceptions. The benefit does not expire for dependents meeting the newer eligibility criteria\u00b3\u2074.\n\nAdditional notes include that children cannot receive Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) and DEA simultaneously, and DEA benefits do not count against the maximum 48 months of other educational benefits. The benefit cannot be used for flight school but can be used for overseas programs\u00b2.\n\nIn summary, Chapter 35 DEA is a VA program offering education benefits to eligible dependents of certain Veterans or servicemembers, helping them pursue various educational and training opportunities with specific eligibility and usage rules\u00b3\u2074.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Chapter 35 (Dependents' Educational Assistance - DEA) - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/pnt)  \n\u00b2 [Benefit - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)  \n\u00b3 [Eligibility Requirements for Dependent Children and Spouses - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/ears)  \n\u2074 [Eligibility Requirements for Dependent Children (Historical) - (notes)](https://veteransbenefitskb.com)",

Tuition and fees for approved programs are covered, with additional provisions for private or foreign schools and the Yellow Ribbon Program for private institutions\u00b3.\n\nTherefore, vocational training is an eligible use of both Chapter 30 and Chapter 33 GI Bill benefits, provided the program is approved by the VA.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n\u00b9 [Chapter 30 (Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) - Active Duty) (Part 3) - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter30montgomeryg)\n\n\u00b3 [Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill) (Part 3) - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter33post911gibi)",

In that case, the VA restores the GI Bill eligibility months used and counts those months against the VR&E entitlement only\u00b3.\n\nAdditionally, when using VR&E, you do not use up any of your GI Bill entitlement by using VR&E, but you need to apply for the Post 9/11 GI Bill to show eligibility for the housing allowance rate\u00b2.\n\nIn summary, you cannot use VR&E and DEA simultaneously, but you can use GI Bill education benefits and VR&E, with some conditions regarding entitlement limits and retroactive induction.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Veterans Readiness and Employment (VR&E) Chapter 31 - FAQ](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vre#faq)  \n\u00b2 [Other Benefits of VRE (Part 3)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vre#otherbenefitsofvre)  \n\u00b3 [GI Bill Education Benefits](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibill#gibilleducationbenefits)",

This can include reenlistments without breaks in service\u00b2\u2075.\n\nKey points about the Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33) include:\n\n- Provides up to 36 months of education benefits.\n- Covers full tuition and mandatory fees at public institutions.\n- Tuition and fees at private or foreign schools are capped at a national maximum rate.\n- May include a housing allowance if attending at least one class in a classroom setting.\n- Public colleges/universities must charge in-state tuition to veterans using this benefit, provided residency requirements are met or waived\u2076.\n\nThe Montgomery GI Bill (Chapter 30) offers benefits generally payable for 10 years following honorable discharge and includes options like the $600 Buy-Up Program for increased monthly benefits and possible additional \"kicker\" payments for critical shortage MOSs\u00b3\u2075.\n\nIn summary, the Forever GI Bill primarily refers to the Post-9/11 GI Bill's removal of the time limit on benefit usage for veterans discharged after 2013, along with provisions allowing combined benefits from both Montgomery and Post-9/11 GI Bills under certain conditions\u2074\u2075.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill) (Part 2)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter33post911gibi)  \n\u00b2 [Chapter 30 (Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) - Active Duty) (Part 1)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter30montgomeryg)  \n\u00b3 [Chapter 30 (Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) - Active Duty) (Part 3)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter30montgomeryg)  \n\u2074 [Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill) (Part 2)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter33post911gibi)  \n\u2075 [Chapter 30 (Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) - Active Duty)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibill#chapter30montgomerygibillmgibactiveduty)  \n\u2076 [Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill) (Part 3)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter33post911gibi)",

It is primarily an employment program rather than just a means to obtain a graduate-level degree\u00b9.\n\nWhile the context does not provide a detailed list of specific payments or benefits VR&E covers, it implies that the program supports employment goals, which may include training and education related to employment. Additionally, VR&E provides a housing allowance paid monthly in arrears, with payments made by the Treasury Department within a 10-business-day window around the end of each month\u2076.\n\nTherefore, VR&E pays for services and support aimed at helping veterans achieve employment, including potentially education and training, and provides a housing allowance during participation in the program.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Veterans Readiness and Employment (VR&E) Chapter 31 - (employment)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vre#veteransreadinessandemploymentvrechapter31)  \n\u2076 [Veterans Readiness and Employment (VR&E) Chapter 31 - FAQ - (faq)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vre#faq)",

To win such a claim, the Veteran must show:\n\n- They were injured by a federal government employee;\n- The employee was acting within the scope of their official duties;\n- The employee acted negligently or wrongfully; and\n- The negligent or wrongful act proximately caused the injury complained of.\n\nThis type of claim is related to injuries caused by VA care, medical or surgical treatment, examination, or participation in compensated work therapy programs. It covers disabilities caused, worsened, or death resulting from VA negligence\u00b3.\n\nTo submit a federal tort claim, a Veteran or their legal representative must complete a Standard Form 95 and submit it to the VA Office of General Counsel, Torts Law Group. The claim must be received within 2 years of the injury, and unlike 1151 claims, the federal government has no duty to assist in gathering evidence, so the claimant must provide all necessary evidence themselves.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Winning a Federal Tort Claim - (claims_special)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/1151#winningafederaltortclaim)  \n\u00b2 [Winning a Federal Tort Claim - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/1151#winningafederaltortc)  \n\u00b3 [38 USC 1151 Claims (VA Negligence) - (claims_special)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/1151#38usc1151claimsvanegligence)",

        "content": "\u26a0\ufe0f **Note:** My sources may not fully cover this topic. Our internal confidence score is **48.6%** for this response - please verify the answer with your own due diligence. A report has been generated and someone will review this.\n\nThe Nehmer rule refers to a VA policy under 38 CFR 3.816 that requires the VA to grant earlier effective dates for service connection (SC) for certain conditions that become presumptive for Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange. Specifically, when a new presumptive condition is added to the regulation, the VA must review prior denied claims and grant earlier effective dates if there was evidence of the condition before it became presumptive. This means veterans do not need to file a separate claim for an earlier effective date if their prior claim was denied before the condition was presumptive but there was evidence of the condition at that time.\n\nKey points about the Nehmer rule include:\n- It applies only to conditions named in 38 CFR 3.309(e), excluding chloracne.\n- It does not apply to claims filed after the condition became presumptive.\n- Conditions like hypertension and MGUS are currently not eligible for Nehmer consideration.\n- If the original claim was denied before September 25, 1985, Nehmer does not apply, but liberalizing law may still apply.\n- The VA is required to grant service connection effective as of the date of the initial claim when there is evidence of diagnosis before the condition became presumptive.\n\nFor example, if a Vietnam veteran filed a claim for lung cancer before it became presumptive and there was medical evidence of lung cancer at that time, the VA must grant service connection effective from the date of that initial claim, even if the claim was initially denied.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Nehmer Class Members (38 CFR 3.816) (Part 4) - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/agentorange#nehmerclassmembers38)  \n\u00b2 [Nehmer Class Members (38 CFR 3.816) (Part 3) - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/agentorange#nehmerclassmembers38)",

        "content": "Chapter 35 Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) is a VA education benefit program that provides education benefits to the spouse and dependent children (including step and adopted children) of a Veteran or Servicemember who meets certain criteria. These criteria include if the Veteran is permanently and totally disabled from service-connected conditions, died in service, died of service-connected causes, or is currently missing in action or captured in the line of duty\u00b9.\n\nThe DEA program can be used for pursuing undergraduate or graduate degrees, courses leading to certificates or diplomas from business, technical, or vocational schools, apprenticeship, and on-the-job training programs. Benefits for correspondence courses are available to spouses only. The program provides up to 45 months of education or training for those who used their benefits before August 1, 2018, and 36 months for those who use the benefits on or after that date\u00b2.\n\nEach dependent eligible for DEA gets their own individual entitlement, and the benefit is paid directly to the dependent. The benefit cannot be used for flight school but can be used for overseas programs. Children cannot receive both Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) and DEA at the same time\u00b2.\n\nEligibility requirements vary depending on when the qualifying event occurred and the age and education status of the dependent child or spouse. For example, children must generally be between 18 and 26 years old, with some exceptions, and spouses lose eligibility if divorced from the Veteran unless certain conditions apply\u00b3\u2074.\n\nIn summary, Chapter 35 DEA is an education benefit program for dependents of certain Veterans or servicemembers, providing financial support for various educational and training programs under specific eligibility criteria\u00b3\u2074.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Chapter 35 (Dependents' Educational Assistance - DEA)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/pnt)  \n\u00b2 [Benefit - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)  \n\u00b3 [Eligibility Requirements for Dependent Children and Spouses - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/ears)  \n\u2074 [Eligibility Requirements for Dependent Children (Historical) - (notes)](https://veteransbenefitskb.com)",

These children must be between 18-26 years old, with some exceptions for active duty service and extensions up to age 31\u00b3.\n  - For children who meet eligibility criteria on or after August 1, 2023, the DEA benefits do not expire, and spouses divorced from the Veteran lose eligibility immediately\u2077.\n  - Children attending an approved high school can use DEA benefits for up to 5 months until August 1, 2026, without those months counting toward benefit limits\u00b3\u2077.\n\n- To apply for education benefits, the dependent child must apply from their own account and, once approved, will receive a Certificate of Eligibility to present to their school's Certifying Official\u2075.\n\n- Children using DEA benefits will no longer increase their parent's disability compensation if the parent is rated at least 30% disabled\u2075.\n\nIn summary, your children may be eligible for CHAMPVA healthcare coverage and education benefits under specific conditions related to age, schooling, and the Veteran's service-connected status or death.

After the screening, Veterans receive information about benefits, registry exams, and clinical resources they may need. Veterans can request the screening at their VA health care appointment, contact their local VA facility, or schedule a telehealth screening via the VET-HOME website\u00b9.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Toxic exposure screenings - (presumptive)](https://www.va.gov/resources/the-pact-act-and-your-va-benefits/#toxicexposurescreenings)",

This law applies if you lived, worked, or were otherwise exposed at Camp Lejeune for at least 30 days total between August 1, 1953, and December 31, 1987, or if your mother was exposed at Camp Lejeune for at least 30 days during that period while pregnant with you. The Act enables filing for relief under this authority, typically starting with an administrative claim with the Department of the Navy.

Submit your Certificate of Eligibility (COE) to your school, typically to the school\u2019s certifying official (SCO), financial aid office, or military/Veteran liaison. When you submit your COE, be sure to ask to apply for your school\u2019s Yellow Ribbon Program.  \n3. Wait for your school to determine if they have available spots in the program and the amount of money you will receive.  \n4. Your school will notify you if you are approved and the amount of Yellow Ribbon funding you will receive.  \n\nThis process ensures your participation in the Yellow Ribbon Program if your school offers it and you meet their criteria\u00b9.\n\n**Sources:**  \n\u00b9 [Application Process - (education)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/yellow#applicationprocess)",

If this is not met, an advisory opinion from VA Central Office is required, which may be unfavorable, and denial may require appeal to the Board of Veterans Appeals (BVA)\u00b9\u00b3.\n\nAid and Attendance is distinct from other related benefits such as Special Aid and Attendance (SMC R), which has additional criteria related to the level of care and supervision required daily by the veteran.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Aid and Attendance (Pension)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/pension-aa#aidandattendancepension)  \n\u00b3 [SMC L (Aid and Attendance)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/smc#smclaidandattendance)",

Additionally, the veteran should have service-connected disabilities that combine to at least 100% for the in-fact housebound status.\n\nHousebound status can result in eligibility for Special Monthly Compensation (SMC S) or increased VA Pension benefits, depending on whether the condition is service-connected or non-service-connected.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Housebound - Special Monthly Pension - (pension)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/pension-housebound#houseboundspecialmonthlypension)  \n\u00b2 [SMC S (Housebound)/(Statutory Housebound) - (compensation)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/smc#smcshouseboundstatutoryhousebound)",

Aid and Attendance is awarded to veterans who need daily help with basic needs such as eating, dressing, and bathing, or who are permanently bedridden, among other criteria\u00b9. \n\nFor veterans who need aid and attendance due to non-service related conditions, they may qualify for an increased VA Pension that includes Aid and Attendance benefits\u00b2. For those whose need for aid and attendance is due to service-connected disabilities, they may qualify for Special Monthly Compensation (SMC) at levels such as SMC L or SMC R1/R2, which also cover aid and attendance\u00b3\u2076.\n\nAdditionally, VA nursing home care is available for veterans enrolled in the VA health system who need nursing home care for service-connected disabilities or who have a 70% or higher service-connected disability. For others, eligibility for nursing home care depends on income and pension status\u2075.\n\nIn summary, Aid and Attendance benefits can apply to veterans in nursing homes if they meet the criteria related to needing assistance with daily living or are bedridden, and the benefit can be part of an increased pension or special monthly compensation depending on service connection and disability rating.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [SMC L (Aid and Attendance)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/smc#smclaidandattendance)  \n\u00b2 [Aid and Attendance (Pension)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/pension-aa#aidandattendancepension)  \n\u00b3 [SMC L (Aid and Attendance)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/smc#smclaidandattendance)  \n\u2075 [70%](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/combinedbenefits)  \n\u2076 [SMC R (Special Aid and Attendance)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/smc#smcrspecialaidandattendance)",

Failure to send this notice is a common error related to the duty to assist.\n\nThe VA will provide assistance even if the claim is vague or incomplete by seeking clarification or informing the claimant of missing information.\n\nHowever, the VA's duty to assist with providing a medical examination or medical opinion only applies if all three of the following elements are met:\n\n1. A statement of symptoms or current diagnosis.\n2. An in-service event or a service-connected disability that caused or worsened the condition.\n3. A reasonable possibility that the condition is related to service (nexus).\n\nIf these elements are not all met, the VA has no duty to provide an exam or medical opinion.

The VA will not pay fees to obtain records, and if a private provider charges for copies, the VA will cancel the request and notify the veteran that it is now their responsibility to provide those records.\n\nIf the veteran fails to respond timely (within 30 days) to requests for necessary details or release forms, the VA may decide the claim without further attempts to get those records.\n\nIn summary:\n- VA will make reasonable efforts (usually 2 attempts) to obtain relevant records.\n- Veteran must provide necessary release forms for private records.\n- Veteran is ultimately responsible for supplying records if VA cannot obtain them.\n- VA will notify the veteran if records cannot be obtained despite efforts.\n- VA will not pay fees for obtaining records.\n- Failure to respond timely may result in VA making a decision without further attempts.\n\nTherefore, while the VA does have a duty to assist and will try to get your records, it is ultimately your responsibility to provide them if the VA cannot obtain them after reasonable efforts\u00b9\u00b3.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Obtaining Records - (claims_process)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/dta#obtainingrecords)  \n\u00b3 [Obtaining/Types of Evidence - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals)",

Also, if you reenlisted or had an earlier honorable period of service, you may still qualify for the GI Bill, though benefits might be prorated if the honorable service period was not long enough to earn full entitlement\u00b2.\n\n- For VA disability benefits, generally, your character of discharge must be Honorable (including General, Under Honorable) to be eligible\u2074 \u2077. However, even if your discharge was not Honorable, you may still be eligible in some cases, especially if you have a mental health diagnosis and apply for a discharge upgrade\u00b3 \u2074.\n\n- Some benefits explicitly cannot be granted based on certain disability claims (like 1151 grants), but this does not directly relate to discharge status\u2075.\n\nIn summary, an OTH discharge can limit eligibility for many VA benefits, but exceptions exist, especially if you have prior honorable service or pursue a discharge upgrade.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [GI Bill Education Benefits - FAQ](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibill#faq)  \n\u00b2 [GI Bill Education Benefits - FAQ](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibill#faq)  \n\u00b3 [Discharge Upgrade](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)  \n\u2074 [Eligibility](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/upgrade)  \n\u2075 [Forbidden Ancillary Benefits](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/1151#forbiddenancillarybe)  \n\u2077 [Eligibility](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com)",

Essentially, a dishonorable discharge generally bars you from VA benefits related to service connection for disabilities caused by misconduct.\n\nAdditionally, eligibility for VA benefits requires that the veteran's character of discharge was **not** dishonorable. Certain crimes and circumstances can also make a veteran ineligible, including federal or state capital crimes and sex offender convictions with life imprisonment sentences\u2075.\n\nRegarding education benefits like the GI Bill, a dishonorable discharge typically disqualifies you from benefits unless you had a prior honorable period of service or reenlistment that qualifies you.

        "content": "Pre-existing condition aggravation refers to the worsening of a condition that existed before military service due to that service. Specifically, it involves a preexisting (pre-service) condition that is made worse by military service, which can lead to service-connection for the aggravated condition.\n\nKey points about pre-existing condition aggravation include:\n\n- The Veteran must have had the condition before service, which is typically documented during the Military Entrance Processing Station (MEPS) physical examination. If the condition was not recorded at that time, the VA presumes the Veteran was sound (had no condition) at entry, unless exceptions apply.\n\n- Exceptions to the presumption of soundness include chronic conditions diagnosed shortly after service entry that likely existed before service, or medical evidence showing the condition existed prior to service (e.g., medical records or in-service x-rays showing healed fractures).\n\n- Statements by the Veteran or others about the condition existing before service have no weight unless supported by medical evidence.\n\n- If the Department of Defense lost the entrance physical records, the VA assumes no preexisting condition unless exceptions apply.\n\n- To establish aggravation, the VA must determine the severity of the condition before and after aggravation and obtain a medical opinion that the service-connected condition worsened the preexisting condition beyond its natural progression.\n\n- When rating an aggravated preexisting condition, the VA subtracts the preexisting condition's severity from the current severity to determine the aggravated rating. If the preexisting condition would rate 100%, the final aggravated rating will be 100%\u00b3.\n\nIn summary, pre-existing condition aggravation is when military service worsens a condition that existed before service, and the VA can grant service connection for the increased severity caused by service under specific evidentiary and rating rules.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n\u00b9 [Aggravation of a Preexisting (Pre-service) Condition](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/agg#aggravationofapreexistingpreservicecondition)  \n\u00b2 [Aggravation of an Existing (Post-service) Condition](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/agg#aggravationofanexistingpostservicecondition)  \n\u00b3 [Rating Aggravated Conditions](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/agg#ratingaggravatedconditions)",

Our internal confidence score is **49.9%** for this response - please verify the answer with your own due diligence. A report has been generated and someone will review this.\n\nYou can file a claim without having medical records in hand, but there are important considerations:\n\n- You must have the bare minimum evidence before filing a claim, which includes:\n  1. A statement of symptoms or a current diagnosis.\n  2. An in-service event or a service-connected disability that caused or worsened your condition.\n  3. A nexus (a layperson would think the symptoms and the in-service event are related).  \n  If you do not have all three parts, your claim may be denied without even being sent to a Compensation & Pension Exam (C&P)\u00b9.\n\n- If you do not have private medical records or non-VA hospital reports, you can provide VA Form 21-4142/21-4142a to authorize the VA to obtain those records for you\u00b2.\n\n- The VA can access your VHA medical records themselves, so it is not necessary to upload them yourself when filing a claim\u00b3.\n\n- You do not need to have a diagnosis to claim something when filing a Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD) claim\u2074.\n\nIn summary, while you can file a claim without medical records, you should at least provide a statement of symptoms, evidence of an in-service event, and a nexus. You can also authorize the VA to obtain your medical records for you.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [BARE MINIMUM You Need BEFORE You File a Claim:](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vaclaim)  \n\u00b2 [Miscellaneous Evidence - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)  \n\u00b3 [Filing a Claim - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vaclaim)  \n\u2074 [Filing a BDD Claim - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vaclaim)",

Our internal confidence score is **48.6%** for this response - please verify the answer with your own due diligence. A report has been generated and someone will review this.\n\nThe Nehmer rule refers to a VA policy under 38 CFR 3.816 that requires the VA to grant earlier effective dates for service connection (SC) for certain conditions that become presumptive for Vietnam Veterans exposed to Agent Orange. Specifically, when a new presumptive condition is added to the regulation, the VA must review prior denied claims and grant earlier effective dates if there was evidence of the condition before it became presumptive. This means that veterans do not need to file a new claim for an earlier effective date if their prior claim was denied before the condition was recognized as presumptive, as long as the claim was filed before the presumptive date and there is evidence of diagnosis. However, Nehmer applies only to conditions named in 38 CFR 3.309(e) except chloracne, and does not apply to claims filed after the condition became presumptive or to conditions not yet added to the regulation. Additionally, some conditions like hypertension and MGUS are not eligible for Nehmer consideration. Claims filed after the condition became presumptive are still eligible for liberalizing law consideration but not Nehmer.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Nehmer Class Members (38 CFR 3.816) (Part 4) - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/agentorange#nehmerclassmembers38)  \n\u00b2 [Nehmer Class Members (38 CFR 3.816) (Part 3) - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/agentorange#nehmerclassmembers38)",

This backdating is not limited by the liberalizing law rules, and the appeal does not need to be continuously pursued. Additionally, if the condition was later granted on appeal through any basis (secondary, direct, different presumptive), the VA can reopen the issue and award an earlier effective date under 38 CFR 3.816.\n\nClaims or appeals do not need to have originally named Agent Orange as the basis of the condition to qualify for Nehmer benefits.\n\nExamples include:\n- A Veteran whose claim for lung cancer was initially denied before the condition became presumptive can have the effective date backdated to the original claim date.\n- A Veteran who filed a claim for coronary artery disease before it became presumptive can have the effective date backdated to the earlier claim date if medical evidence showed diagnosis at that time.\n\nHowever, if your original claim was denied before September 25, 1985, Nehmer does not apply, though liberalizing law may still be considered.\n\nIn summary, if your situation fits these criteria, you can get an earlier effective date under Nehmer\u00b3\u2074\u2075.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Nehmer Class Members (38 CFR 3.816) (Part 1)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/agentorange#nehmerclassmembers38)  \n\u00b2 [Nehmer Class Members (38 CFR 3.816) (Part 4)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/agentorange#nehmerclassmembers38)  \n\u00b3 [Nehmer Class Members (38 CFR 3.816) - (claims_special)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/nehmer#nehmerclassmembers38cfr3816)  \n\u2074 [Nehmer Class Members (38 CFR 3.816) (Part 3)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/agentorange#nehmerclassmembers38)  \n\u2075 [Nehmer Class Members (38 CFR 3.816) - (presumptive)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/agentorange#nehmerclassmembers38cfr3816)",

        "content": "Permanent and Total (P&T) disability is a special status granted to veterans that signifies they are paid at the 100% disability rate (total) and their disabilities are considered static (permanent). However, the term \"permanent\" is somewhat misleading because it does not mean the disability rating cannot be reduced. The VA generally cannot reduce a rating if it has been held for at least 20 years, except in cases of fraud. Veterans with P&T status do not have regularly scheduled reexaminations unless specific conditions apply. The decision letter for P&T does not explicitly state the status but indicates entitlement to Dependents Educational Assistance (DEA). Veterans can be P&T even if their combined rating is under 100%, such as through Total Disability Individual Unemployability (TDIU). P&T veterans can work unless they have work restrictions due to TDIU\u2075\u2076.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Permanent and Total (P&T) Disability - (rating_info)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/pnt#permanentandtotalptdisability)  \n\u00b2 [Permanent and Total (P&T) Disability - FAQ - (faq)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/pnt#faq)  \n\u2075 [Permanent and Total (P&T) Disability - FAQ - (faq)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/pnt#faq)  \n\u2076 [Permanent and Total (P&T) Disability - FAQ - (faq)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/pnt#faq)",

P&T refers to the overall status of being permanently rated at 100%, while TDIU is a specific type of 100% rating based on unemployability.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Permanent and Total (P&T) Disability - FAQ](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/pnt#faq)  \n\u00b2 [Permanent and Total (P&T) Disability - FAQ](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/pnt#faq)  \n\u00b3 [Permanent and Total (P&T) Disability - FAQ](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/pnt#faq)  \n\u2074 [Permanent and Total (P&T) Disability - (rating_info)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/pnt#permanentandtotalptdisability)  \n\u2075 [Unemployability - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/IU)",

        "content": "PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) is rated under the general mental disorder ratings system, which bases the rating on the severity of the Veteran's total symptoms rather than the specific diagnosis. PTSD is not rated differently from other mental health disorders in terms of the rating criteria, but it does have unique criteria for service-connection, requiring an in-service stressor and a separate examination (DBQ) from other mental health conditions.\n\nThe rating for PTSD depends on the level of occupational and social impairment caused by the symptoms. For example, a 50% rating corresponds to occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity due to symptoms such as panic attacks more than once a week, difficulty understanding complex commands, impaired judgment, and disturbances of motivation and mood. The Veteran may be mostly able to care for themselves but may have difficulty maintaining employment and social relationships\u00b2.\n\nAdditionally, PTSD symptoms can overlap with Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) symptoms. The VA may lump the ratings together unless the examiner can clearly separate the symptoms of PTSD and TBI, in which case separate ratings can be assigned\u2074.\n\nIn summary:\n- PTSD is rated like other mental disorders based on symptom severity.\n- Service-connection for PTSD requires an in-service stressor.\n- Ratings reflect occupational and social impairment from symptoms.\n- PTSD ratings can be combined or separated from TBI ratings depending on symptom differentiation.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Mental Disorder Ratings](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)  \n\u00b2 [PTSD Service-Connection](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)  \n\u00b3 [50% - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)  \n\u2074 [PTSD & TBI - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)",

Our internal confidence score is **49.6%** for this response - please verify the answer with your own due diligence. A report has been generated and someone will review this.\n\nSMC K is a Special Monthly Compensation awarded to Veterans who have experienced loss of use or amputations of specific body parts or functions. It is paid in addition to regular disability compensation, except in cases involving SMC O, Q, R, and T, where it is not paid out. Veterans can receive up to three separate SMC K awards. Each award corresponds to the loss or loss of use of a specific limb, but the same award cannot be given more than once for the same limb. Additionally, a single SMC K award is given for loss of use of a reproductive organ, regardless of the number of affected parts or related conditions such as erectile dysfunction or female sexual arousal disorder (FSAD).\n\nImportant notes include that Veterans who had elective vasectomies or hysterectomies are generally not eligible for SMC K unless they are service-connected for related conditions like erectile dysfunction or FSAD.\n\n\u00b9 [SMC K (Amputation/Loss of use of Body Part(s) or Function(s))](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/smc#smckamputationlossofuseofbodypartsorfunctions)\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [SMC K (Amputation/Loss of use of Body Part(s) or Function(s))](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/smc#smckamputationlossofuseofbodypartsorfunctions)",

SMC K, for example, is awarded for loss of use or amputations of specific body parts or functions. This includes limbs or reproductive organs when they are non-functional due to service connection. A single SMC K award is given for each limb lost or rendered non-functional, but you cannot receive multiple awards for the same limb. Similarly, loss of use of a reproductive organ qualifies for one SMC K award regardless of the number of affected parts or conditions like erectile dysfunction or female sexual arousal disorder\u00b9.\n\nAdditionally, SMC levels such as L \u00bd and others consider anatomical loss or loss of use of limbs at or above certain joints, indicating that loss of use is treated similarly to anatomical loss for compensation purposes\u00b2\u00b3.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [SMC K (Amputation/Loss of use of Body Part(s) or Function(s)) - (compensation)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/smc#smckamputationlossofuseofbodypartsorfunctions)  \n\u00b2 [SMC L \u00bd - (compensation)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/smc#smcl)  \n\u00b3 [SMC P (Half Step Increases) - (compensation)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/smc#smcphalfstepincreases)",

        "content": "A PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) stressor is an event or experience that occurs during military service and causes the development of PTSD. For VA disability claims, PTSD requires an in-service stressor, which means the stressor must have happened during the veteran's service. These stressors can include a wide range of traumatic events, not limited to direct combat exposure. Examples of PTSD stressors include:\n\n- Aircraft crashes\n- Assault or battery\n- Environmental disasters (earthquakes, fires, floods, etc.)\n- Fear of hostile enemy forces\n- Harassment, including military sexual trauma (MST), sexual assault, sexual harassment, rape\n- Mugging or robbery\n- Serving as a drone aircraft crew member\n- Serving in mortuary affairs\n- Stalking\n- Training accidents\n- Vehicular crashes\n\nIt is important to note that fear of hostile enemy forces does not include anticipation of future deployment or learning of a death that occurred away from the veteran in a hostile location\u00b9.\n\nAdditionally, a veteran's lay testimony alone may establish an in-service stressor under certain conditions, such as if the PTSD diagnosis is related to combat, being a prisoner of war, or fear of hostile military or terrorist activity, with confirmation by a VA psychiatrist or psychologist that the claimed stressor is adequate to support the diagnosis and symptoms are related to the stressor\u00b3.\n\nIn summary, a PTSD stressor is a qualifying traumatic event experienced during service that can be linked to the veteran's PTSD diagnosis for service connection purposes.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [PTSD Service-Connection - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)",

        "content": "To verify a PTSD stressor, the VA follows a specific procedure that involves reviewing various types of evidence to establish the credibility of the claimed in-service stressor. The key steps and types of evidence include:\n\n- Reviewing all available evidence of record, including the Veteran's submitted evidence such as VA Form 21-0781 (Supporting Statements for Service Connection for PTSD), service records, medical evidence, and lay or other evidence\u00b9.\n- Corroborating the stressor type by examining relevant documents and records depending on the nature of the stressor (combat, non-combat, personal trauma, etc.)\u00b9.\n- Evidence that the VA looks at to verify in-service stressors includes:\n  - After action reports (AARs)\n  - Buddy letters (VA Form 21-10210)\n  - Combat awards, badges, decorations on the Veteran's DD-214\n  - Command chronologies and war diaries\n  - Contemporaneous letters and diaries\n  - Daily staff journals\n  - Police or insurance reports\n  - Private medical records\n  - Monthly summaries and morning reports\n  - Muster rolls\n  - Newspaper accounts of the traumatic event\n  - Operational reports and lessons learned\n  - Radio logs, deck logs, and ship histories\n  - Service treatment records (STRs) or service personnel records\n  - Personal statements (VA Form 21-4138)\n  - Unit and organizational histories\u00b2.\n- For non-combat stressors, the VA concedes the event when credible supporting evidence:\n  - Documents the Veteran's participation in the event\n  - Indicates the Veteran served in the immediate area and at the time the event occurred\n  - Supports the description of the event\n  Corroborating evidence for non-combat stressors is not limited to service records but may include other sources\u2074.\n- Stressors can be claimed and researched based on information found in VA Form 21-0781, lay statements, military records indicating combat participation or service in hostile areas, and medical records or examiner statements. In some cases, examinations can be ordered without specific stressor details, but if a PTSD diagnosis is made, the stressor must be verified as consistent with service circumstances\u2075.\n\nIn summary, verifying a PTSD stressor involves gathering and reviewing a wide range of evidence to establish the occurrence and credibility of the stressor during military service, with particular emphasis on VA Form 21-0781 and supporting documentation from service and other records.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [3.

        "content": "VA math, or the combined ratings calculation, is the method the VA uses to combine multiple disability ratings into a single overall disability rating. This process is not a simple addition of percentages but follows a specific formula and rules outlined in regulations and VA manuals.\n\nKey points about VA math include:\n\n- The combined rating is calculated using the Combined Ratings Table found in 38 CFR \u00a7 4.25, which provides the method for combining multiple disability ratings\u00b9.\n- When a veteran has disabilities affecting both sides of the body (bilateral disabilities), the VA applies a bilateral factor to increase the combined rating. The application of this bilateral factor is governed by 38 CFR \u00a7 4.26 and VA policy manuals such as M21-1\u00b9.\n- To know if the bilateral factor has been applied to your conditions, you can check your VA Codesheet, which lists your disability ratings and any applied factors\u00b2.\n- The combined rating calculation ensures the total disability rating does not exceed 100%, although under certain circumstances, veterans may receive Special Monthly Compensation (SMC) that results in higher payments without exceeding the 100% rating\u00b3.\n\nIn summary, VA math involves combining individual disability ratings using a specific table and applying factors like the bilateral factor when appropriate, resulting in a combined rating that reflects the overall level of disability for compensation purposes.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [VA Math - Combined Ratings Calculation - Legal References](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vamath#references)  \n\u00b2 [VA Math - Combined Ratings Calculation - FAQ](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vamath#faq)  \n\u00b3 [VA Math - Combined Ratings Calculation - FAQ](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vamath#faq)",

        "content": "The VA does not simply add disability ratings together because disability ratings are not meant to be combined by simple addition. Instead, the VA uses a combined ratings table and applies specific calculation methods, including the bilateral factor when applicable, to determine the overall combined rating. This method accounts for the fact that a veteran cannot be more than 100% disabled and that disabilities may overlap in their impact on the veteran's functioning.\n\nFor example, when combining ratings, the VA starts with the highest rating and then combines the next rating with the remaining \"non-disabled\" percentage, rather than adding them directly. Additionally, if the veteran has bilateral disabilities (affecting both sides of the body), the VA applies a bilateral factor, which adds an additional 10% of the combined bilateral ratings to the total. This ensures a more accurate representation of the veteran's overall disability impact without exceeding the maximum 100% rating\u00b9.\n\nThis approach prevents the total rating from exceeding 100% and reflects the reality that multiple disabilities do not simply stack linearly in terms of impairment.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [VA Math - Combined Ratings Calculation - Legal References](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vamath#references)",

        "content": "To calculate your combined VA disability rating, follow these general steps:\n\n1. **List all your individual disability ratings.** Start with the highest rating and work downward.\n\n2. **Use the VA Combined Ratings Table** to combine two ratings at a time. The process is not a simple addition; instead, you combine ratings using the table or formula that accounts for the fact that ratings are not additive beyond 100%.\n\n3. **Apply the bilateral factor if applicable.** If you have disabilities affecting both sides of the body (bilateral conditions), after combining those ratings, add 10% of the combined bilateral rating to the total. This is done by taking 10% of the combined bilateral rating and adding it to that rating before combining with other ratings.\n\n4. **Continue combining ratings stepwise.** After combining bilateral conditions and applying the bilateral factor, combine the result with your other ratings one by one using the combined ratings table.\n\n5. **Round to the nearest whole number** at each step as needed.\n\n6. **The final combined rating cannot exceed 100%.** Although the combined rating tops out at 100%, certain veterans may qualify for Special Monthly Compensation, which can provide additional benefits beyond 100%.\n\nExample from the context:\n\n- Left knee = 30%\n- Right knee = 10%\n- Combine 30% and 10% using the combined ratings table = 37%\n- Apply bilateral factor: 10% of 37% = 3.7%, add to 37% = 41%\n- Then combine 41% with other ratings stepwise\n\nThis process continues until all ratings are combined into a single combined rating\u00b9\u2074\u2075.\n\nTo verify if your conditions have been given the bilateral factor, you can check your VA Codesheet.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n\u00b9 [VA Math - Combined Ratings Calculation - FAQ](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vamath#faq)  \n\u00b2 [VA Math - Combined Ratings Calculation - Legal References](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vamath#references)  \n\u2074 [Bilateral Factor (Part 2)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vamath#combined)  \n\u2075 [Bilateral Factor (Part 2)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vamath#combined)  \n\u00b3 [VA Math - Combined Ratings Calculation - FAQ](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vamath#faq)",
