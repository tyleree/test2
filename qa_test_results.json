        "content": "To file a VA disability claim, you have several options:\n\n- Use a Veterans Service Officer (VSO) to assist you with the claim. You can find a VSO near you through the VA website\u00b9\u00b3.\n- File online yourself at VA.gov through the disability claim filing section\u00b3.\n- Complete and submit VA Form 21-526EZ either online, by fax (844-531-7818), in person at a VA Regional Office, or by mail to the Claims Intake Center in Janesville, WI\u00b3.\n- If you want to file a Fully Developed Claim (FDC) or a Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals (BDD) claim, you can also do so online or with the help of a VSO\u00b2.\n- You can start with an Intent to File to preserve your effective date, which can be submitted online, by phone, by mail, fax, or in person using VA Form 21-0966\u2076.\n\nImportant notes:\n- You do not need to have a diagnosis to file a claim\u00b2.\n- If you file a new claim while another is active, the VA will combine the claims but may close the new claim initially\u00b3.\n- The VA uses the date your claim is processed, not the postmark date, to determine your effective date\u00b3\u2077.\n\nIt is strongly recommended to use a VSO to help you through the process for best results\u00b9\u2074.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Filing a VA Disability Claim](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vaclaim)  \n\u00b2 [Filing a BDD Claim](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vaclaim)  \n\u00b3 [Filing a Claim](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vaclaim)  \n\u2074 [How to File](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals)  \n\u2076 [Starting an Intent to File](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vaclaim)  \n\u2077 [Submitting a Supplemental Claim](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals#995)",

DBQs give you an idea of what the exam will cover and the types of questions or tests you might expect. You can find DBQs for various conditions such as cervical spine, thoracolumbar spine, traumatic brain injury (TBI), cranial nerve conditions, arthritis, fibromyalgia, osteomyelitis, breast conditions, and gynecological conditions\u00b3\u2074\u2075\u2076\u2077.\n\n- If you want, you may ask your treating physician or another doctor to complete a DBQ on your behalf and submit it with your claim. This can help provide detailed medical information to the VA before your exam\u00b3\u2074\u2075\u2076\u2077.\n\n- You can include a personal statement with your claim if you want to request a specific contractor or VA medical center for your exam, or if you prefer a tele-health appointment for your mental health exam. The VA will try to honor reasonable requests\u00b9.\n\n- Keep your contact information (mailing address, email, phone number) up to date with the VA to ensure you receive timely notice of your exam appointment\u2074.\n\nBy reviewing the DBQ relevant to your condition and preparing any personal statements or medical documentation, you can be better prepared for your C&P exam.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Compensation & Pension Examinations (C&P)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/cnp)  \n\u00b2 [Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQs)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/cnp)  \n\u00b3 [Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQs)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/cnp)  \n\u2074 [After Submitting a Claim](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vaclaim)  \n\u2075 [Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQs)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/cnp)  \n\u2076 [Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQs)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/cnp)  \n\u2077 [Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQs)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/cnp)",

It is important because it preserves your effective date, which determines when you start receiving payments from the VA. For recently separated Veterans, an Intent to File can be automatically opened the day after separation, and if filed before the one-year separation anniversary, it allows up to an additional year to file the claim while still receiving back pay from the day after separation\u00b9.\n\nYou can submit an Intent to File in several ways, including online at VA.gov, through a Veterans Service Officer (VSO), by phone, in person using VA-Form 21-0966, by fax, or by mail. The Intent to File is valid for one year and is good for one use only, although a single claim can cover multiple conditions.

        "content": "Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD) is a VA program that allows active duty servicemembers who are between 180 and 90 days before separation to file a disability claim within that window. The goal of BDD is to get a head start on the claim process so that the veteran can receive a decision on their claim the day after they separate from active duty. However, this outcome is not guaranteed.\n\nKey points about BDD include:\n\n- You must submit your Service Treatment Records (STRs) no later than 90 days before separation to remain in the BDD program.\n- Private medical records are generally not included in STRs unless you arrange to have them added.\n- You do not need to attend all your exams before the window closes or before separation.\n- It is important to keep the VA updated on your location for proper notification of examinations.\n- If you have less than 90 days before separation, you can and should still file a claim, though it may not be under the BDD program.\n- Filing can be done online via VA.gov or with the assistance of a Veterans Service Officer (VSO).\n\nBDD is designed to facilitate a smoother transition from active duty to veteran status by expediting the disability claims process\u00b9\u2074\u00b2.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD) - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/digsystem)  \n\u00b2 [Filing a BDD Claim - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vaclaim)  \n\u2074 [Active Duty Servicemembers - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/cnp)",

      "response": {
        "success": true,
        "content": "A supplemental claim is an opportunity to submit new and relevant evidence to the VA to support a previously denied claim. \"New\" evidence means the VA did not previously have or consider it, and \"relevant\" evidence directly addresses the rationale for the denial. Examples of new and relevant evidence include medical records, independent medical opinions, personal statements, buddy statements, or a new theory of service connection. Veterans have one year from the claim's decision to file a supplemental claim to potentially keep their back pay. It is recommended to wait until you have enough evidence before filing\u00b9.\n\nYou can submit a supplemental claim through various methods, including online forms, in-person via a Veterans Service Organization (VSO) or lawyer, or by mail. However, the VA uses the date the appeal is processed, not the postmark date, to determine timeliness, so timely submission is critical\u00b2.\n\nThe supplemental claim process involves a review of the new evidence by a VA reviewer rather than a rater, which may take longer. You can submit additional evidence within 90 days after your Notice of Disagreement (NOD) is received\u00b3.\n\nThe status of a supplemental claim typically shows as either \"We don't know your status\" or \"A reviewer is examining your new evidence\" until the claim is closed out\u2074.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Supplemental Claim (20-0995)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals#995)  \n\u00b2 [Submitting a Supplemental Claim - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals#995)  \n\u00b3 [2.

Our internal confidence score is **48.2%** for this response - please verify the answer with your own due diligence. A report has been generated and someone will review this.\n\nYes, you can reopen a denied claim by filing a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995). This allows you to submit new and relevant evidence that was not previously considered by the VA. New evidence can include things like new medical records, an independent medical opinion (IMO) or nexus letter, personal statements, buddy statements, or a new theory of service connection. It is important that the evidence directly addresses the reason for the denial, such as providing a diagnosis if that was missing before. You have one year from the date of the decision to file a Supplemental Claim to potentially keep your back pay. If you were previously denied because you missed a VA exam, you can state on the Supplemental Claim form that you are now willing and able to attend the exam\u00b9.\n\nIf your claim was denied due to lack of service connection, you should determine what was missing\u2014such as a current diagnosis, an in-service event, or a medical opinion linking the condition to service. If you believe the VA did not properly evaluate your evidence, a Higher-Level Review (HLR) might be appropriate. Otherwise, submitting additional supporting evidence through a Supplemental Claim is recommended\u00b2.\n\nDo not file a new claim for the same or a similar condition that was previously denied, as it will be rejected and you will be directed to appeal instead. Appeals include Supplemental Claims, Higher-Level Reviews, or Board Appeals\u00b3.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Supplemental Claim (20-0995)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals#995)  \n\u00b2 [Denied Service-Connection - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals)  \n\u00b3 [BEFORE Filing a Claim for a New Disability - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vaclaim)",

Board of Veterans Appeals (BVA)\n\nKey points to consider when appealing:\n\n- You must file your appeal within one year of your claim's decision date to keep your effective date (back pay). Missing this deadline means you can only get your original effective date if there is a Clear and Unmistakable Error (CUE)\u00b9.\n- You cannot file multiple appeals for the same issue at the same time without first withdrawing the current appeal\u00b9.\n- If you filed an appeal to the BVA and are waiting, you cannot file a supplemental claim for the same issues while the BVA case is pending\u00b9.\n- Lawyers and claims agents can only charge up to 33.3% of your back pay and only get paid if you win your appeal. VSOs are free resources\u00b9.\n- Before appealing, carefully read your decision letter to understand what evidence was considered, favorable findings, missing information, or exams required\u2074.\n\nSubmitting your appeal:\n\n- For Higher-Level Review, Supplemental Claim, or BVA, you can submit online, via your VSO or lawyer, by mail, or fax (for BVA)\u00b2 \u2075 \u2076.\n- For BVA appeals, you must submit within one year of your claim's decision, and you cannot request another BVA appeal for the same issue immediately after a BVA decision\u00b3.\n- BVA appeals are reviewed by Veterans Law Judges who can make decisions independent of VA Central Office policies\u00b3.\n\nIn summary:\n\n- Choose your appeal method (HLR, Supplemental Claim, or BVA).\n- File within one year of the decision date.\n- Submit your appeal through the appropriate channels.\n- Use VSOs or lawyers for assistance if desired.\n- Follow instructions in your decision letter to strengthen your appeal.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n\u00b9 [Filing an Appeal](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals)  \n\u00b2 [Submitting to BVA](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals)  \n\u00b3 [Board Veterans' Appeals (BVA) AKA, Notice of Disagreement (NOD), AKA 10182](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals)  \n\u2074 [BEFORE You File an Appeal](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals)  \n\u2075 [Submitting an HLR](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals)  \n\u2076 [Submitting a Supplemental Claim](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals#995)",

        "content": "A Higher-Level Review (HLR) is an entirely new review of your claim conducted by an experienced, more senior rater known as a Decision Review Officer (DRO). This review involves a fresh look at the evidence already of record but does **not** allow the submission or consideration of any new evidence received after the original decision was made. The DRO has the authority to issue differences of opinion, which means they can weigh the existing evidence differently to potentially reach a more favorable outcome for the veteran. However, differences of opinion cannot result in a negative outcome for the veteran. If there were Clear and Unmistakable Errors (CUEs) in the previous decision, those can be corrected even if the correction results in a negative outcome, provided appropriate due notice is given.\n\nAdditional important points about Higher-Level Reviews include:\n\n- Veterans cannot file an HLR consecutively (back-to-back) but can file an HLR into a supplemental claim and so on.\n- Veterans cannot request an HLR after a Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA) denial.\n- The HLR must be submitted within one year of the claim's decision.\n- New evidence cannot be submitted or considered during an HLR.\n\nIn summary, an HLR is a senior rater's review of the existing evidence in a claim to potentially correct or improve the decision without introducing new evidence\u00b9.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Higher-Level Review (HLR 20-0996)](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-20-0996-ARE.pdf)",

Examples of new and relevant evidence include medical records, new theories of service connection, independent medical opinions, personal or buddy statements, or willingness to attend a new examination. Veterans have **1 year** from the decision on their claim to file a Supplemental Claim to potentially preserve their effective date for back pay\u00b9.\n\nThere are several ways to submit a Supplemental Claim, including online, by paper form, through a Veterans Service Organization (VSO) or lawyer, in person at a VA Regional Office, or by mail. It is important to note that the VA uses the date the appeal is processed, not the postmark date, to determine timeliness, so late processing can result in loss of the effective date\u00b2.\n\nA Supplemental Claim is reviewed by a VA rater who considers the new evidence submitted. The claim status may show as \"We don't know your status\" or \"A reviewer is examining your new evidence\" until the claim is resolved\u2074.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Supplemental Claim (20-0995)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals#995)  \n\u00b2 [Submitting a Supplemental Claim - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals#995)  \n\u2074 [Supplemental Claim Status - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals#995)",

Board of Veteran Appeals (BVA)\n\nIf one method is denied, you can file an appeal using a different method, but you cannot file multiple appeals for the same issue simultaneously without first withdrawing the current appeal.\n\nAdditionally, if you want to keep your effective date (your back pay), you must file an appeal within one year of your claim's decision date. If you miss this deadline, you can only get your original effective date and back pay if there is a Clear and Unmistakable Error (CUE).\n\nIf your claim was denied service connection, consider whether you were missing a current diagnosis, an in-service event, or if the examiner found it less likely than not that your disability was related to service. If you believe the rater did not properly evaluate the evidence, a Higher-Level Review may be appropriate. If you need to submit additional supporting information, a supplemental claim may be appropriate. You can submit new and relevant evidence such as independent medical opinions, personal statements, or buddy statements. If you missed an exam, you can file a supplemental claim stating you are willing and able to attend exams\u00b9\u2074\u2075.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Filing an Appeal - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals)  \n\u00b2 [BEFORE You File an Appeal - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals)  \n\u2074 [Denied Service-Connection - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals)  \n\u2075 [Supplemental Claim (20-0995) - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals#995)",

The rating percentage reflects how much the disability decreases the Veteran's overall health and ability to function.\n\nFor mental health conditions, the rating is determined by evaluating the totality of symptoms and evidence submitted, including C&P examiner reports, Disability Benefits Questionnaires (DBQs), nexus letters, buddy letters, personal statements, treatment notes, and other supporting documents. The rater assigns a percentage that most closely matches the Veteran's overall symptom picture rather than requiring every single symptom to be present\u00b9.\n\nThe VBA uses diagnostic codes to identify specific conditions and applies the rating criteria in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities to assign a disability percentage. This percentage corresponds to the severity and impact of the condition on the Veteran's daily life and employability\u00b9\u2074.\n\nIt is important to provide comprehensive and accurate evidence to demonstrate the severity of the disability, as misrepresenting the condition is a crime.

        "content": "\u26a0\ufe0f **Note:** My sources may not fully cover this topic. Our internal confidence score is **49.1%** for this response - please verify the answer with your own due diligence. A report has been generated and someone will review this.\n\nVA math, in the context of disability benefits, refers to how combined disability ratings are calculated and how they affect eligibility for certain benefits. For example, to qualify for Individual Unemployability, a veteran must have two or more service-connected disabilities with at least one rated at 40% or more, and a combined rating of 70% or more. This combined rating must result in the veteran being unable to hold down substantially gainful employment due to their service-connected conditions. Odd jobs or marginal employment do not count against this determination. Additionally, a 70% or higher combined disability rating can make a veteran eligible for certain health care programs, family caregiver assistance, and basic eligibility for VA nursing homes, among other benefits\u00b9.\n\nIn education benefits, VA math involves proration of payments such as the housing allowance. Unlike VA disability payments, which are not prorated, education benefits like the Monthly Housing Allowance (MHA) can be prorated based on enrollment status and the number of days in a month. For instance, if a course starts partway through a month, the MHA is paid proportionally based on a 30-day calendar month.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [70% - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/combinedbenefits)  \n\u00b2 [Frequently (Part 3) - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vre#frequently)",

Our internal confidence score is **48.3%** for this response - please verify the answer with your own due diligence. A report has been generated and someone will review this.\n\nA protected rating in the context of VA disability benefits refers to a rating percentage that is safeguarded from reduction for a certain period of time after it has been assigned. For example, if a veteran initially receives a 10% rating for a condition, that 10% rating is protected for 5 years. If the rating is later increased (e.g., to 30%), the new increased rating does not immediately receive the same 5-year protection. However, the original 10% rating retains its 5-year protection and even a 20-year protection if it has been held for that long. This means the veteran cannot have the original rating reduced during those protected periods, even if the condition changes or is reevaluated.\n\nIn summary:\n- The 5-year protection applies only to the original rating percentage, not to the increased rating.\n- The original rating can also have a 20-year protection if it has been held for 20 years.\n- The increased rating does not automatically get the same protection as the original rating.\n\nThis protection ensures stability in the veteran's disability compensation for a specified time frame after the rating is assigned or increased.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Example Involving Increase - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/ratingsindex#protection)  \n\u00b2 [Example Involving Increase - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/ears)",

Our internal confidence score is **47.4%** for this response - please verify the answer with your own due diligence. A report has been generated and someone will review this.\n\nThe 5 year rule refers to the protection a Veteran has against reduction of their disability rating based on a single Compensation & Pension (C&P) exam showing improvement. Specifically:\n\n- A Veteran's rating generally cannot be reduced based on just one exam that shows improvement if the evaluation has been held for at least 5 continuous years.\n- Continuous improvement must be shown before a reduction proposal can be issued.\n- In most cases, the VA will require another exam confirming continued improvement before issuing a proposal for reduction if it affects the combined rating.\n- There are exceptions, such as conditions rated based on lab results (e.g., kidney or lung function), where a single lab result showing improvement can lead to a reduction if the Veteran has filed for an increase and the VA confirms the improvement.\n- This 5-year protection does not reset after 5 years. For example, if improvement was shown at year 6 and again at year 16, the VA can still seek to reduce the rating based on those findings.\n\nIn summary, the 5 year rule protects Veterans from rating reductions based on a single exam showing improvement if the rating has been stable for 5 continuous years, requiring continuous improvement to justify a reduction.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [5 Years - Reductions (38 CFR 3.344) - (references)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/ears)  \n\u00b2 [5 Years - Reductions (38 CFR 3.344) - (references)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/ratingsindex#protection)",

After 10 years:\n\n- The Veteran's erroneously service-connected condition can still be increased if warranted.\n- Disabilities caused by the erroneously service-connected condition can be service-connected on a secondary basis.\n- The VA can reassign the location of a disability grant (e.g., left vs. right side) even after 10 years, but if this results in a reduced evaluation, the VA must provide due process and propose the change.\n- Periods when the Veteran is returned to Active Duty do not count toward the 10-year calculation.\n\nThis rule essentially protects the Veteran's service-connection from being removed after 10 years, with some specific exceptions and provisions for adjustments.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [10 Years - Service-Connection (38 CFR 3.957) - (references)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/ratingsindex#protection)  \n\u00b2 [10 Years - Service-Connection (38 CFR 3.957) - (references)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/ears)",

This means once a Veteran has held a benefit or rating for 20 years, it generally cannot be lowered or taken away.\n\nSpecial notes related to this rule include:\n- If the VA erroneously granted service-connection for a disability involving a specific location (such as left vs. right side or upper vs. lower), the VA can reassign the location even after 20 years. If this reassignment results in a reduced evaluation, the VA must provide due process and propose the change.\n- Periods when a Veteran returns to Active Duty do not count toward the calculation of this 20-year protection.\n- Special Monthly Compensation (SMC) based on need for aid and attendance can be paused if the Veteran is hospitalized at government expense.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [20 Years - Total Protection (38 CFR 3.951)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/ears)  \n\u00b2 [20 Years - Total Protection (38 CFR 3.951)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/ratingsindex#protection)",

        "content": "PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) is rated by the VA as a mental health disorder based on the severity of the totality of the Veteran's symptoms, not on the formal diagnosis itself. A Veteran with PTSD receives a single combined mental health rating regardless of the number of mental health diagnoses they have\u00b9 \u2077.\n\nFor service-connection, PTSD requires an in-service stressor, which can include a variety of traumatic events such as combat exposure, assault, military sexual trauma, environmental disasters, and other specified stressors. However, anticipation of future deployment or learning of a death away from the Veteran in a hostile area does not qualify as an in-service stressor\u00b3.\n\nThe VA uses specific symptom criteria to determine the rating percentage. For example, a 50% rating corresponds to occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity due to symptoms such as panic attacks more than once a week, difficulty understanding complex commands, impaired judgment, disturbances of mood, and difficulty maintaining effective work and social relationships\u00b2.\n\nAdditionally, PTSD and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) symptoms often overlap, and the VA may lump these ratings together unless the symptoms are clearly separable, in which case separate ratings can be assigned\u2074.\n\nUltimately, the rating decision is based on the totality of symptoms and evidence, including C&P examiner reports, DBQs, personal statements, and other supporting documentation\u2075.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Mental Disorder Ratings - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)  \n\u00b2 [50% - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)  \n\u00b3 [PTSD Service-Connection - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)  \n\u2074 [PTSD & TBI - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)  \n\u2075 [How a Rater Decides - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/cnp)  \n\u2077 [Mental Disorders - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)",

The Veteran's ability to care for themselves may be mostly intact but hygiene may not always be maintained, and they may occasionally be hospitalized. They may be able to work but have difficulty maintaining employment for long periods, and social relationships may be short-lived due to inability to be an active participant\u00b9.\n\nAlso, for service-connection of PTSD, an in-service stressor is required, which can include a wide range of traumatic events such as combat-related fear, assault, military sexual trauma, accidents, and others\u00b2.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n\u00b9 [50% - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)  \n\u00b2 [PTSD Service-Connection - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)",

The rating does not depend on the specific diagnosis but on the overall severity of symptoms. Here are some key rating levels for anxiety and related mental disorders:\n\n- **10% rating**: Occupational and social impairment due to mild or transient symptoms which decrease work efficiency and ability to perform occupational tasks only during periods of significant stress, or symptoms controlled by continuous medication. Symptoms include mild anxiety, depression, or mood changes; rare mild panic attacks; occasional sleep disturbances. The veteran is always able to care for themselves and rarely has problems working. Social relationships may have occasional issues\u00b9\u00b3.\n\n- **30% rating**: Occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks. Symptoms may include depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, panic attacks (weekly or less often), chronic sleep impairment, and mild memory loss. The veteran can usually take care of themselves but may occasionally be hospitalized. Work ability is occasionally impaired, and social relationships may be strained\u00b9\u2075.\n\n- **50% rating**: Occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity due to symptoms such as flattened affect, panic attacks more than once a week, difficulty understanding complex commands, impaired memory and judgment, disturbances of motivation and mood, and difficulty maintaining effective work and social relationships. The veteran is mostly able to care for themselves but hygiene may not always be maintained. Work may be possible but difficult to sustain long term. Social relationships may be short-lived\u00b9\u2076.\n\nThe rating is based on the totality of symptoms rather than the specific anxiety diagnosis, and a veteran receives a single rating regardless of the number of diagnoses\u00b9\u2074.\n\n**Sources:**",

The Veteran receives a single rating regardless of the number of formal diagnoses they have. The rating depends on how severe the symptoms are and how much they impair occupational and social functioning\u00b9.\n\nFor example, a 50% rating corresponds to occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity due to symptoms such as:\n\n- Flattened affect\n- Panic attacks more than once a week\n- Difficulty understanding complex commands\n- Impairment of short- and long-term memory\n- Impaired judgment and abstract thinking\n- Disturbances of motivation and mood\n- Difficulty establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships\n\nAt this level, the Veteran is mostly able to care for themselves and perform daily tasks but may have difficulty maintaining long-term employment and relationships. Symptoms may include extreme lack of motivation, mood swings, severe anxiety, and multiple panic attacks per week\u00b2.\n\nUltimately, the rating is determined by the rater based on the totality of symptoms and all evidence submitted, including medical examinations, treatment records, and personal statements\u00b3.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Mental Disorder Ratings - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)  \n\u00b2 [50% - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)  \n\u00b3 [How a Rater Decides - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/cnp)",

Our internal confidence score is **45.2%** for this response - please verify the answer with your own due diligence. A report has been generated and someone will review this.\n\nOccupational and social impairment refers to the degree to which a veteran's mental health symptoms affect their ability to work and interact socially. It ranges from mild or transient symptoms that only occasionally decrease work efficiency and social interactions, to total impairment where the veteran is unable to work or maintain social relationships due to severe symptoms.\n\n- Mild occupational and social impairment involves symptoms such as mild anxiety or depression that decrease work efficiency only during significant stress, occasional social issues, and symptoms controlled by medication. The veteran is usually able to care for themselves and rarely has problems working\u00b9.\n\n- Total occupational and social impairment involves severe symptoms like persistent delusions or hallucinations, grossly inappropriate behavior, constant risk of harm to self or others, inability to perform daily living activities, disorientation, and memory loss. The veteran is unable to care for themselves, cannot work, and does not engage in social relationships except in a one-way manner directed toward them\u00b2.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [10% - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)  \n\u00b2 [100% - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)",

        "content": "The VA evaluates mental health disorders based on the severity of the totality of a Veteran's symptoms rather than the specific formal diagnosis. Veterans receive a single combined rating for their mental health conditions regardless of the number of diagnoses they have, except in the case of an eating disorder, which is rated separately from other mental health disorders\u00b9\u00b3.\n\nThe rating decision is made by a rater who considers all the evidence submitted, including:\n\n- Compensation & Pension (C&P) examiner's report\n- Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ)\n- Nexus letters\n- Buddy letters (VA Form 21-10210)\n- Personal statements (VA Form 21-4138)\n- Supporting statements for PTSD claims (VA Form 21-0781)\n- Private and VA treatment records\n- Vet Center notes (with written permission)\n\nThe rater assesses the totality of symptoms and evidence to assign a rating percentage that most closely matches the Veteran's overall symptom severity. It is not necessary to meet every example symptom for a particular rating level, and having some symptoms associated with a higher rating does not guarantee that rating\u00b2.\n\nFor example, a 50% rating corresponds to occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity due to symptoms such as flattened affect, panic attacks more than once a week, impaired judgment, difficulty understanding complex commands, and disturbances in motivation and mood. This rating reflects a Veteran who may be mostly able to care for themselves but has difficulty maintaining employment and social relationships\u2074.\n\nHonesty during the C&P exam is critical, and exaggerating or fabricating symptoms should be avoided\u00b3.\n\nIn summary, the VA evaluates mental health by looking at the overall impact of symptoms on occupational and social functioning, using all available evidence to assign a single disability rating that reflects the Veteran's level of impairment\u00b3.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Mental Disorder Ratings - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)  \n\u00b2 [How a Rater Decides - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/cnp)  \n\u00b3 [Mental Disorders - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)  \n\u2074 [50% - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)",

      "response": {
        "success": true,
        "content": "Back pain is generally rated by the VA based on the limitation of Range of Motion (ROM) of the spine, rather than the specific diagnosis of the back condition. The rating focuses on the Veteran's neck (cervical spine) or the rest of the back (thoracolumbar spine). Key points include:\n\n- The examiner and rater must consider flare-ups and estimate the impairment on the Veteran's worst day if the exam is not conducted on that day. The most impaired ROM measurements are used for rating\u00b9.\n- Veterans can receive separate ratings for the neck and the back but only one rating per section of the spine (neck or thoracolumbar) even if multiple conditions affect the same section\u00b3.\n- The rating percentages are based on forward flexion and combined ROM measurements. For example, for the back (thoracolumbar):\n  - 0% rating if forward flexion is 90\u00b0 or more or combined ROM is 240\u00b0 or more.\n  - 10% rating if forward flexion is more than 60\u00b0 but not more than 85\u00b0, or combined ROM is between 125\u00b0 and 240\u00b0.\n  - Higher ratings correspond to more severe limitations in ROM\u00b3.\n- Arthritis of the spine is rated under degenerative arthritis if ROM ratings do not apply, but degenerative disc disease (DDD) is not considered arthritis and is rated separately\u2074.\n- Pain with motion can also affect ratings, but specific rules apply for different joints (e.g., hip or shoulder), and the VA may only award a single rating under ROM for pain with motion\u2076\u2077.\n\nIn summary, back pain ratings primarily depend on the limitation of spinal range of motion, including flare-ups, with separate ratings possible for neck and back sections, and arthritis or pain with motion may influence the rating under certain conditions.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [(Back and Neck) - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/spine)  \n\u00b3 [DC 5235 - through 5242 Ratings Based Off Limitations of Range of Motion - (rating_table)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/nervesystem#5235)  \n\u2074 [Arthritis of the Spine - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/spine)  \n\u2076 [Pain with Motion - (rating_table)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/hip)  \n\u2077 [Pain with Motion - (rating_table)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/shoulder)",

The rating process involves the following steps:\n\n- Both ears are evaluated together; a single rating is assigned for hearing loss, not separate ratings for each ear.\n- If an ear is not service-connected, it is considered to have 100% perfect hearing for rating purposes, unless special conditions apply.\n- The puretone audiometry test measures the auditory threshold at specific frequencies (500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz).\n- The speech discrimination test measures the ability to understand spoken words, expressed as a percentage.\n- The results from both tests for each ear are converted into a Roman numeral classification (I through XI) using a table that cross-references puretone threshold averages with speech discrimination percentages.\n- Using the Roman numeral classifications for the worst ear and the best ear, a rating table is used to determine the overall disability percentage.\n- To qualify for any rating, hearing loss must meet at least one of these criteria:\n  - Auditory threshold of 40 decibels or greater at any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz;\n  - Auditory thresholds of 26 decibels or greater at at least three of those frequencies;\n  - Speech recognition scores less than 94 percent.\n- If one ear is service-connected and the other is not, the VA may consider the non-service-connected ear as service-connected for rating purposes if:\n  - The non-service-connected ear was not due to willful misconduct;\n  - The non-service-connected ear has hearing loss for VA purposes;\n  - The service-connected ear rates at least 10% by itself.\n\nThis method ensures that the combined hearing ability of both ears is considered in determining the disability rating, which can range from 0% to higher percentages depending on the severity of hearing loss in both ears\u00b3.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Rating Table - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/ears)  \n\u00b2 [DC 6100 - Hearing Loss - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/ears#6100)  \n\u00b3 [Puretone and Speech Discrimination Table - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/ears)",

      "response": {
        "success": true,
        "content": "Scars are rated by the VA based on several factors including their location, size, characteristics, and associated symptoms such as pain or instability. The rating process includes the following key points:\n\n- The body is divided into six areas (torso front, back, left arm, right arm, left leg, right leg), and scars in each area can be rated separately. However, if combining scar sizes from different areas results in a higher rating, that method is used instead. Deep and superficial scars in the same area receive separate ratings. If scars cause range of motion issues, a separate rating for that impairment can be granted\u00b9.\n\n- Scars involving the head, face, or neck are rated differently, focusing on visible or palpable disfigurement or the additive effect of scars. Characteristics considered include scar length, width, attachment to underlying tissue, abnormal skin color or texture, and underlying soft tissue loss. Multiple scars cannot be combined to meet width requirements, but all scars in these areas are considered together for area calculations\u2075.\n\n- Painful or unstable scars can receive an additional rating. For VA purposes, pain must be noted by an examiner upon touching the scar. If a scar is both painful and unstable, the rating under this schedule is increased by 10%. The rating for painful or unstable scars depends on the number of such scars: 10% for 1-2 scars, 20% for 3-4 scars, and 30% for 5 or more\u2072.\n\n- Superficial scars, which affect only the skin and not underlying tissues, are rated 10% if they cover 144 square inches (929 cm\u00b2) or more\u2077.\n\n- For other scars not covered by specific codes, they are rated under the diagnostic code that best captures the impairment\u2074.\n\n- Additionally, the general rating formula for skin conditions considers the extent of lesions and the need for topical or systemic therapy, with ratings ranging from 0% to 60% based on coverage and treatment requirements\u00b3.\n\nIn summary, scars are rated based on location, size, depth, symptoms like pain or instability, and impact on function, with specific diagnostic codes and criteria applied accordingly.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Scars NOT Involving the Head, Face, or Neck - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/skin)  \n\u00b2 [DC 7804 - Painful or Unstable Scars - (rating_table)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/skin#7804)  \n\u00b3 [General Rating Formula For The Skin - (rating_table)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/skin)  \n\u2074 [DC 7805 - All other Scars - (condition_definition)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/skin#7805)  \n\u2075 [DC 7800 - Scars and Disfigurement Involving the Head, Face, or Neck - (rating_table)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/skin#7800)  \n\u2077 [DC 7802 - Superficial Scars - (rating_table)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/skin#7802)",

        "success": true,
        "content": "TBI symptoms are rated based on the severity of the residual symptoms a Veteran has after the injury. The VA considers 10 specific areas of impairment related to TBI. The Veteran is evaluated in each of these areas, but the final TBI rating is based on the area with the highest level of impairment. The Veteran will not receive 10 separate ratings; rather, a singular rating is assigned unless it is more beneficial to separate some symptoms into their own ratings\u00b9.\n\nAdditionally, if the examiner diagnoses a TBI but notes no residual symptoms, a 0% rating is granted if service connection is warranted\u00b9.\n\nWhen rating, the VA must avoid \"pyramiding,\" meaning they cannot assign multiple ratings for the same symptoms. This is particularly important because TBI symptoms often overlap and can be complex to rate. For example, vertigo cannot be rated separately from TBI even if it might warrant a higher evaluation on its own\u2076.\n\nIf a Veteran has both TBI and PTSD, the VA often lumps these ratings together due to overlapping symptoms. However, if a medical professional can clearly separate the symptoms of TBI and PTSD, the Veteran may receive two separate ratings\u2075.\n\nThe severity of the TBI itself (mild, moderate, severe) is determined by factors such as loss of consciousness duration, brain imaging results, disorientation, amnesia, and Glasgow Coma Scale scores, but this severity classification is separate from how residual symptoms are rated\u00b3.\n\nIn summary:\n- Evaluate 10 areas of impairment for residual symptoms.\n- Assign a single TBI rating based on the highest impairment area unless separate ratings are more beneficial.\n- No multiple ratings for the same symptoms (no pyramiding).\n- Separate ratings for TBI and PTSD possible only if symptoms are clearly distinguishable.\n- 0% rating if TBI diagnosed but no residual symptoms.\n- Severity classification is based on initial injury characteristics but does not directly determine the rating percentage\u00b3\u2075\u2076.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [How TBI is Rated](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/TBI)  \n\u00b2 [TBI Rating Example](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/TBI)  \n\u00b3 [Severity of TBI](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/TBI)  \n\u2075 [PTSD & TBI](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)  \n\u2076 [Pyramiding](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals)",

This evidence can include:\n\n- Medical evidence showing the secondary condition and its connection to the primary service-connected disability, such as private medical records or non-VA hospital reports that relate to your claimed secondary condition or show it has worsened. You must provide VA Form 21-4142/21-4142a if you want VA to obtain these records for you.\n\n- Buddy statements or personal statements that describe how and when the secondary condition developed, how it worsened, and how it currently affects you.\n\n- An independent medical opinion or nexus letter that connects the secondary condition to the service-connected disability.\n\n- New medical examinations or DBQs (Disability Benefits Questionnaires) if applicable.\n\n- Evidence of a nerve-based secondary condition linked to a spinal condition may be considered quasi-presumptive, making it easier to grant unless conflicting evidence exists.\n\nRemember, you have one year from the claim's decision to file an appeal and develop additional evidence. It is recommended to gather sufficient evidence before filing to increase the chances of success\u00b3\u2074.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Supplemental Claim (20-0995)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals#995)  \n\u00b2 [2.

A report has been generated and someone will review this.\n\nThe context provided does not explicitly state whether Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) can be considered secondary to PTSD medication. However, it does mention that secondary conditions may arise from mental disorders and/or the medications used to treat them, and that these secondary disabilities may also be service-connected if properly diagnosed and supported by medical evidence.\n\nSince GERD is listed as a common secondary condition, it is possible that GERD could be secondary to medications used for PTSD or other mental disorders, but there is no direct confirmation or specific criteria provided in the context to definitively say GERD is secondary to PTSD medication.\n\nTherefore, while GERD can be a secondary condition related to mental health treatment, the context does not explicitly confirm GERD as secondary to PTSD medication.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [DC 7206 - Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease - (rating_table)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/digsystem#7206)  \n\u00b2 [Common Secondary Conditions - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/claimtype#secondary)  \n\u00b3 [PTSD Service-Connection - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)",

This assumption is often based on evidence showing a strong link between the condition and certain service-related exposures or events. For example, certain mental health conditions diagnosed within a specific timeframe after service, or diseases developing after a traumatic brain injury (TBI), may be considered presumptive. Additionally, some conditions must reach a minimum severity rating (e.g., at least 10%) within a defined period to qualify as presumptive. The VA establishes specific criteria such as timing of diagnosis after service or exposure, severity of the condition, and type of service or exposure to determine presumptive status\u00b3\u2074.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Presumptive Conditions - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/presumptive)  \n\u00b2 [Presumptive Secondary Conditions - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/claimtype#secondary)  \n\u00b3 [Presumptive Diseases - (presumptive)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/agentorange#presumptivediseases)  \n\u2074 [Presumptive Diseases Continued (Part 1) - (presumptive)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/agentorange#presumptivediseasesc)",

      "response": {
        "success": true,
        "content": "The GI Bill refers to education benefits provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs to eligible veterans to help cover the costs of education and training.\n\n- **Chapter 30 (Montgomery GI Bill - Active Duty)** provides up to 36 months of a monthly stipend for various educational programs including college degrees, technical courses, apprenticeships, flight training, and more. Benefits are generally payable for 10 years following honorable discharge. There is also a $600 Buy-Up Program allowing servicemembers to contribute additional funds for increased benefits, and a Kicker program for certain critical shortage MOSs that increases monthly payments\u00b9\u00b3.\n\n- **Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill)** offers up to 36 months of education benefits for those who served on active duty after September 10, 2001. It covers full tuition and mandatory fees at public institutions, with caps for private or foreign schools. It may also include a housing allowance if attending in-person classes. Veterans discharged before January 1, 2013, have 15 years to use the benefit; those discharged after have no time limit. The benefit usage is prorated based on the rate of pursuit (credit load)\u00b9\u2074\u2075.\n\n- An important update from April 16, 2024, by the Supreme Court allows veterans who served at least two qualifying periods\u2014one for the Montgomery GI Bill and another for the Post-9/11 GI Bill\u2014to potentially receive additional GI Bill benefits. This can include reenlistments without breaks in service.\n\nIn summary, the GI Bill encompasses multiple programs (notably Chapter 30 and Chapter 33) that provide veterans with financial support for education and training, with specific eligibility criteria, benefit amounts, and usage rules depending on the chapter.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Chapter 30 (Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) - Active Duty) (Part 3)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter30montgomeryg)  \n\u00b2 [Chapter 30 (Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) - Active Duty) (Part 1)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter30montgomeryg)  \n\u00b3 [Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill) (Part 1)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter33post911gibi)  \n\u2074 [Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill) (Part 2)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter33post911gibi)  \n\u2075 [Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill) (Part 3)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter33post911gibi)",

        "content": "The Chapter 33 Post-9/11 GI Bill is an education benefit program that provides up to 36 months of education benefits to veterans who have served on active duty after September 10, 2001. It can be used for various educational purposes including attending institutions of higher learning, training, licensing, and certification reimbursement. Veterans attending at least one class in a classroom may be entitled to receive a housing allowance equal to the military Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) for an E-5 with dependents at the location of the school where the majority of classes are taken.\n\nThe program covers full tuition and mandatory fees for public higher learning institutions and caps tuition and fees for private or foreign schools at a national maximum rate. Veterans attending private schools may also be eligible for the Yellow Ribbon Program, which can cover additional education-related costs not paid by VA. The benefit length is prorated based on the rate of pursuit (the number of credits taken per term).\n\nAdditional benefits include a books and supplies stipend up to $1,000 per year (prorated if less than full time), a rural benefit payment of $500 for certain veterans relocating from highly rural areas, and a \"kicker\" or additional monthly payment for veterans who joined a military occupational specialty (MOS) with a critical shortage of personnel.\n\nEligibility requires an honorable period of active duty service on or after September 10, 2001. Veterans discharged before January 1, 2013, have 15 years to use this benefit, while those discharged after that date have no time limit to use it\u00b3\u2074\u2075.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill) (Part 1)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter33post911gibi)  \n\u00b2 [Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill) (Part 2)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter33post911gibi)  \n\u00b3 [Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill) (Part 3)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter33post911gibi)  \n\u2074 [Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill) (Part 5)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter33post911gibi)  \n\u2075 [Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill) (Part 7)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter33post911gibi)",

        "content": "The Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) is an education benefit program provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs that offers financial assistance to eligible veterans and service members for various types of education and training. There are two main versions of the Montgomery GI Bill:\n\n1. **Chapter 30 (Montgomery GI Bill - Active Duty):**  \n   - Provides up to 36 months of a monthly stipend to eligible veterans.  \n   - Benefits can be used for college degrees, certificate programs, technical or vocational courses, flight training, apprenticeships, on-the-job training, high-tech training, licensing and certification tests, entrepreneurship training, certain entrance exams, and correspondence courses. Remedial, deficiency, and refresher courses may be approved under certain circumstances.  \n   - Eligibility generally requires an honorable discharge, a high school diploma or GED (or in some cases 12 hours of college credit), and meeting specific service criteria.  \n   - Veterans may contribute up to an additional $600 while on active duty to increase their monthly benefits through the $600 Buy-Up Program.  \n   - Some veterans may receive a \"kicker\" (Branch College Fund) if they joined a military occupational specialty (MOS) with a critical shortage of personnel, which increases their monthly benefit.  \n   - Benefits are generally payable for 10 years following release from honorable active service.  \n   - There are different eligibility categories based on service dates and conditions.  \n\n2. **Chapter 1606 (Montgomery GI Bill - Selected Reserve):**  \n   - Provides education and training benefits to eligible members of the Selected Reserve, including various Reserve components and National Guard.  \n   - Also offers up to 36 months of education benefits for similar types of training and education as Chapter 30.  \n   - Includes a kicker for critical shortage MOS similar to Chapter 30 but with a lower maximum amount.  \n   - Eligibility requires a 6-year obligation to serve in the Selected Reserve signed after June 30, 1985, among other requirements.  \n\nOverall, the Montgomery GI Bill helps veterans and reservists pursue education and training opportunities by providing monthly financial benefits for up to 36 months of qualifying education or training programs\u00b3\u2076.\n\n**Sources:**  \n\u00b9 [Chapter 30 (Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) - Active Duty) (Part 3)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter30montgomeryg)  \n\u00b2 [Chapter 30 (Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) - Active Duty) (Part 1)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter30montgomeryg)  \n\u00b3 [Chapter 1606 (Montgomery GI Bill - Selected Reserve) (Part 1)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter1606montgomer)  \n\u2076 [Chapter 1606 (Montgomery GI Bill - Selected Reserve) (Part 2)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter1606montgomer)",

        "content": "The amount the GI Bill pays varies depending on the specific program:\n\n- **Chapter 30 (Montgomery GI Bill - Active Duty):**  \n  Provides up to 36 months of a monthly stipend. Veterans may contribute up to an additional $600 while on active duty through the $600 Buy-Up Program to receive up to $5,400 in additional benefits. There is also a \"kicker\" or Branch College Fund that may add up to $950 per month for certain critical shortage MOSs, paid as a pro-rated lump sum at the start of the semester\u00b9.\n\n- **Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill):**  \n  Provides up to 36 months of education benefits. Full tuition and mandatory fees are paid directly to public higher learning institutions. For private or foreign schools, tuition and fees are capped at the National maximum rate. Veterans attending private institutions may be eligible for the Yellow Ribbon Program for additional costs. If attending at least one class in person, veterans may receive a housing allowance equal to the military BAH for an E-5 with dependents at the school's location. Additionally, veterans may receive a books and supplies stipend up to $1,000 per year, prorated if less than full time\u00b3\u2074\u2075.\n\nThe exact monthly stipend amount for Chapter 30 is not specified in the provided context. The Post-9/11 GI Bill covers tuition and fees fully for public schools and up to capped amounts for private schools, plus housing and book stipends as described.\n\n**Sources:**  \n\u00b9 [Chapter 30 (Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) - Active Duty) (Part 3)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter30montgomeryg)  \n\u00b3 [Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill) (Part 1)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter33post911gibi)  \n\u2074 [Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill) (Part 3)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter33post911gibi)  \n\u2075 [Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill) (Part 5)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter33post911gibi)",

        "content": "The housing allowance for GI Bill education benefits varies depending on whether you are using the Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33) or the Montgomery GI Bill (Chapter 30):\n\n- **Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33):**  \n  - You may be entitled to a Monthly Housing Allowance (MHA) if you are enrolled more than half-time in classes.  \n  - The MHA is based on the zip code of the campus where you physically attend the majority of your classes, not the institution's location.  \n  - The allowance is equal to the military Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) for an E-5 with dependents at that location.  \n  - If enrolled over half-time but less than full-time, the MHA is prorated.  \n  - Those enrolled half-time or less do not receive any MHA.  \n  - MHA is prorated on a 30-day calendar basis depending on the start date of courses.  \n  - For graduate programs, the school determines full-time status; for undergraduate programs, full-time is typically 12 credits in Fall/Spring, 6 in Summer, and 3 in Winter semesters (accelerated programs may differ).\u00b9\u2074\n\n- **Montgomery GI Bill (Chapter 30):**  \n  - There is no mention of a housing allowance similar to the Post-9/11 GI Bill in the provided context. The Montgomery GI Bill provides a monthly stipend for education but does not specify a housing allowance.\u00b3\u2075\n\nIn summary, the housing allowance is specifically a feature of the Post-9/11 GI Bill and depends on enrollment status and location of attendance.

        "content": "Chapter 35 Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) is a program that provides education benefits to the spouse and dependent children (including step and adopted children) of a Veteran or Servicemember who meets certain criteria. These criteria include:\n\n- The Veteran is permanently and totally disabled from service-connected conditions;\n- The Veteran died in service;\n- The Veteran died of service-connected causes; or\n- The Veteran is currently missing in action or captured in the line of duty\u00b9.\n\nThe DEA benefit can be used for pursuing undergraduate or graduate degrees, courses leading to certificates or diplomas from business, technical, or vocational schools, apprenticeship, and on-the-job training programs. Correspondence courses are available to spouses only. The program provides up to 36 months of education or training for beneficiaries who use their Chapter 35 benefits on or after August 1, 2018 (45 months if used before that date). Each dependent gets their own individual entitlement, and the benefit is paid directly to the dependent\u00b2.\n\nAdditional important notes include:\n\n- The benefit cannot be used for flight school but can be used for overseas programs.\n- Children cannot receive Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) and DEA at the same time.\n- DEA benefits do not count against the maximum 48 months of educational benefits if the dependent is eligible for other education benefits\u00b2.\n\nEligibility requirements vary depending on when the event that made the dependent eligible occurred (before or after August 1, 2023) and other factors such as age and educational milestones\u00b3\u2074.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Chapter 35 (Dependents' Educational Assistance - DEA)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/pnt)  \n\u00b2 [Benefit - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)  \n\u00b3 [Eligibility Requirements for Dependent Children and Spouses - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/ears)  \n\u2074 [Eligibility Requirements for Dependent Children (Historical) - (notes)](https://veteransbenefitskb.com)",

Correspondence courses include online courses\u00b9.\n\n- Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill) provides education benefits for approved programs at institutions of higher learning, which can include online courses, though the sources do not explicitly state online courses, correspondence courses are mentioned under Chapter 30, which is similar in scope for education programs\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, online courses, which fall under correspondence or distance learning, are covered by the Montgomery GI Bill and likely by the Post-9/11 GI Bill as well.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n\u00b9 [Chapter 30 (Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) - Active Duty) (Part 3)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter30montgomeryg)  \n\u00b2 [Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill) (Part 1)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter33post911gibi)",

        "content": "Yes, you can use GI Bill education benefits (such as Chapter 30 Montgomery GI Bill or Chapter 33 Post-9/11 GI Bill) and VR&E (Veterans Readiness and Employment) benefits together, but there are some important details to consider:\n\n- VR&E benefits may not exceed 48 months of use. If you have used GI Bill benefits before VR&E, that time counts against the 48-month VR&E limit. However, GI Bill eligibility months used can possibly be restored via Retroactive Induction, potentially allowing you to use the GI Bill again separately from VR&E\u00b9.\n\n- It is possible for someone to use 48 months of VR&E benefits and then separately use 48 months of GI Bill benefits, meaning the two programs have separate maximum eligibility periods\u00b9.\n\n- Veterans who have at least 1 day of Post-9/11 GI Bill eligibility and are using VR&E may receive Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) at the E-5 with dependent rate for their location while in training or education under VR&E. This does not use up any of your GI Bill entitlement by using VR&E\u00b9.\n\n- You will need to apply for the Post-9/11 GI Bill to show you are still eligible or have eligibility left for it in order to get the BAH rate while using VR&E\u00b9.\n\nIn summary, you can use both GI Bill education benefits and VR&E benefits, but the months used under each program count separately toward their respective limits, and there are processes to manage eligibility and allowances when using both.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Other Benefits of VRE (Part 3) - (benefits)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vre#otherbenefitsofvre)  \n\u00b9 [Duration of Program - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vre#durationofprogram)  \n\u00b9 [Other Benefits of VRE (Part 2) - (benefits)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vre#otherbenefitsofvre)",

        "success": true,
        "content": "The \"Forever GI Bill\" refers to the Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33) education benefits, which provide up to 36 months of education benefits to veterans who have served on active duty after September 10, 2001. A key feature of the Forever GI Bill is that for veterans discharged after January 1, 2013, there is no time limit to use these benefits, meaning they do not expire. For those discharged before January 1, 2013, the benefits must be used within 15 years. The benefits include full tuition and mandatory fees paid directly to public institutions, capped tuition for private or foreign schools, and potential eligibility for the Yellow Ribbon Program for additional costs. The housing allowance is also available if attending at least one class in person, based on military BAH rates\u00b9\u2074\u2075.\n\nAdditionally, there is an important update from April 16, 2024, where the Supreme Court ruled that veterans who served at least two periods of service\u2014one qualifying for the Montgomery GI Bill (Chapter 30) and another qualifying for the Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33)\u2014may be eligible for additional GI Bill benefits. This can include reenlistments without breaks in service\u00b2.\n\nThe Montgomery GI Bill (Chapter 30) provides up to 36 months of a monthly stipend, generally payable for 10 years following honorable discharge. It can be used for various educational and training programs and includes options like the $600 Buy-Up Program to increase benefits and a kicker for critical shortage MOSs\u00b3.\n\nIn summary, the Forever GI Bill primarily refers to the Post-9/11 GI Bill with its no-expiration feature for recent veterans, combined with the possibility of additional benefits when combined with Montgomery GI Bill service periods.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill) (Part 1)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter33post911gibi)  \n\u00b2 [Chapter 30 (Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) - Active Duty) (Part 1)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter30montgomeryg)  \n\u00b3 [Chapter 30 (Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) - Active Duty) (Part 3)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter30montgomeryg)  \n\u2074 [Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill) (Part 2)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter33post911gibi)  \n\u2075 [Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill) (Part 3)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter33post911gibi)",

        "content": "Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (Voc Rehab), now known as Veterans Readiness and Employment (VR&E) or Chapter 31, is a VA program designed to help veterans with service-connected disabilities prepare for, find, and maintain suitable employment. The program offers various services including career counseling, job training, education, and assistance with job placement. It is primarily an employment-focused program rather than an educational one, aiming to support veterans in achieving long-term employment success. VR&E also provides additional benefits such as advanced health care coverage, including dental care if necessary for the rehabilitation plan\u00b9.\n\nThe program typically lasts up to 48 months, although extensions may be granted under special conditions. Veterans who have used their GI Bill benefits before VR&E may have that time counted against the 48-month limit, but there are possibilities for restoring GI Bill eligibility through retroactive induction. Certain groups, such as children of Vietnam Veterans and veterans with covered service in Korea, have a maximum eligibility of 24 months instead of 48 months\u00b2.\n\nVR&E offers multiple tracks to assist veterans, including long-term employment services that provide tools like job hunting assistance, career guidance, education at undergraduate and graduate levels, job skill assessments, resume help, apprenticeships, on-the-job training, and volunteer opportunities\u00b3.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Veterans Readiness and Employment (VR&E) - (overview)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vre)  \n\u00b2 [Duration of Program - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vre#durationofprogram)  \n\u00b3 [Tracks (Part 2) - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vre#tracks)",

        "content": "The VR&E (Veterans Readiness and Employment) program offers five different tracks to assist veterans based on their employment and rehabilitation needs:\n\n1. **Reemployment**  \n   Helps veterans regain employment with their former employer, possibly by providing accommodations or assistance. This track is only used if the former job is still suitable given the veteran's disabilities.\n\n2. **Rapid Access to Employment**  \n   For veterans who already have the skills, experience, and education needed but are having trouble finding employment. Services include job hunting assistance, career counseling, interview preparation, and resume help. Short-term certification training may be available.\n\n3. **Self-Employment**  \n   Designed for veterans who want to start their own business. Assistance includes business concept analysis, training in small business operations, marketing, finances, and tuition for certifications or licenses.\n\n4. **Employment Through Long-Term Services**  \n   For veterans needing additional training or assistance to obtain and maintain long-term employment. Services include job hunting help, career guidance, higher education (undergraduate and graduate), job skill assessment, resume help, apprenticeships, on-the-job training, volunteer opportunities, and vocational training. Note that this track is primarily employment-focused, not educational, so pursuing advanced degrees like a master's may be difficult unless employment in the desired field cannot be reasonably obtained otherwise.\n\n5. **Independent Living**  \n   For veterans with service-connected disabilities that limit their ability to perform daily living activities and who cannot return to work immediately. This track requires advanced eligibility: a serious employment handicap, disabilities preventing work, and a need for services to live as independently as possible. It can be used alongside efforts to obtain employment.\n\nThese tracks are designed to tailor services to the veteran's specific situation and goals within the VR&E program\u00b3.\n\n**Sources:**  \n\u00b9 [Veterans Readiness and Employment (VR&E) - (overview)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vre)  \n\u00b2 [Tracks (Part 2) - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vre#tracks)  \n\u00b3 [Tracks (Part 1) - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vre#tracks)",

Here are some key points from the context:\n\n- VR&E benefits may not exceed 48 months of use, and GI Bill benefits used before VR&E count against this 48-month limit. However, GI Bill eligibility months used can possibly be restored via Retroactive Induction, potentially allowing you to use the GI Bill again separately from VR&E benefits.\n\n- It is possible for someone to use 48 months of VR&E benefits and then separately use 48 months of GI Bill benefits.\n\n- When using VR&E, if you have at least one day of Post-9/11 GI Bill eligibility, you can receive Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) at the E-5 with dependent rate for your location without using up your GI Bill entitlement by using VR&E.\n\nThis means VR&E and GI Bill benefits can be coordinated and used together, with some conditions and potential restoration options for GI Bill eligibility if previously used\u2076.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Duration of Program - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vre#durationofprogram)  \n\u00b2 [Other Benefits of VRE (Part 3) - (benefits)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vre#otherbenefitsofvre)  \n\u00b3 [Other Benefits of VRE (Part 2) - (benefits)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vre#otherbenefitsofvre)",

Compensation can be paid for disabilities that result from VA medical care errors, including:\n\n- Acts of omission such as failure to obtain informed consent prior to treatment or failure to provide timely diagnosis or treatment.\n- Errors involving negligence or error in judgment by VA medical personnel.\n- Disability or death caused by direct participation in a compensated work therapy program.\n- Failure to diagnose or treat a condition when a physician exercising proper skill and care would have reasonably been able to do so, and this failure resulted in disability\u00b9.\n\nAdditionally, the disability or death must be caused by VA carelessness, negligence, lack of proper skill, or error in judgment. If the care was provided outside a VA Medical Center but was referred by the VA, and the VA's negligence caused the disability or death, you may also file a 1151 claim\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, if you suffered a disability or death as a result of VA medical error that meets these criteria, you may be eligible for compensation through a 1151 claim.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Detailed Explanation of Criteria (Part 1)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/1151#detailedexplanationo)  \n\u00b2 [Frequently - 1151 Claims](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/1151#frequently)",

This means that veterans who had a diagnosis of the condition before it was officially recognized as presumptive can receive service connection effective from the date of their earlier claim or diagnosis, even if their original claim was denied before the condition became presumptive.\n\nKey points about the Nehmer rule include:\n\n- It applies only to conditions named in 38 CFR 3.309(e), excluding chloracne.\n- It does not apply to claims filed after the condition became presumptive, but those claims may still be eligible under liberalizing laws.\n- Some conditions like hypertension and MGUS are currently not eligible for Nehmer consideration.\n- The VA must grant earlier effective dates as appropriate without the veteran needing to file a new claim for the earlier date.\n\nFor example, if a veteran filed a claim for lung cancer before it became a presumptive condition and had medical evidence of the diagnosis at that time, the VA must grant service connection effective the date of the initial claim, even if the claim was denied initially.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Nehmer Class Members (38 CFR 3.816) (Part 3) - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/agentorange#nehmerclassmembers38)  \n\u00b2 [Nehmer Class Members (38 CFR 3.816) (Part 4) - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/agentorange#nehmerclassmembers38)",

Our internal confidence score is **46.4%** for this response - please verify the answer with your own due diligence. A report has been generated and someone will review this.\n\nTo add your spouse to your VA benefits, you generally need to include them as a dependent when applying or updating your benefits information with the VA. Here are some key points based on the context:\n\n- You must be legally married to the spouse, and the marriage must be active at the time of any relevant claims or benefits\u00b9.\n- Spouses remain eligible as dependents so long as you remain married\u00b2.\n- When applying for certain benefits (such as education benefits), the dependent (spouse) must apply from their own account, but spouses still count as dependents for benefits purposes\u00b3.\n- It is important to notify the VA and provide documentation of your marriage to have your spouse recognized as a dependent.\n\nFor specific applications like education benefits, you can apply online and include your spouse as a dependent during that process\u00b3.\n\nIf you want to ensure your spouse is added to your VA benefits, you should contact the VA directly or use their online portals to update your dependent information.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n\u00b9 [Spouse - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/ears)  \n\u00b2 [Spouses/Widow - (policy)](https://veteransbenefitskb.com)  \n\u00b3 [Applying - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/survivorbenefits#top)",

These criteria include:\n\n- The Veteran is permanently and totally disabled from service-connected conditions;\n- The Veteran died in service;\n- The Veteran died of service-connected causes; or\n- The Veteran is currently missing in action or captured in the line of duty\u00b9.\n\nThe benefit can be used for pursuing undergraduate or graduate degrees, courses leading to certificates or diplomas from business, technical, or vocational schools, apprenticeship, and on-the-job training programs. Correspondence courses are available to spouses only. The program provides up to 45 months of education or training for beneficiaries who used their Chapter 35 benefits before August 1, 2018, and 36 months for those who use the benefits on or after that date. Each dependent receives their own individual entitlement, and the benefit is paid directly to the dependent\u00b2.\n\nAdditional notes include that children cannot receive both DIC (Dependency and Indemnity Compensation) and DEA at the same time, and the benefit cannot be used for flight school but can be used for overseas programs\u00b2.\n\nEligibility requirements vary depending on when the event making the dependent eligible occurred, with different rules for events before or after August 1, 2023, and specific conditions for spouses and children\u00b3\u2074\u2076.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Chapter 35 (Dependents' Educational Assistance - DEA) - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/pnt)  \n\u00b2 [Benefit - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)  \n\u00b3 [Eligibility Requirements for Dependent Children and Spouses - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/ears)  \n\u2074 [Eligibility Requirements for Dependent Children (Historical) - (notes)](https://veteransbenefitskb.com)  \n\u2076 [Eligibility Requirements for Dependent Spouses (Historical) - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/time)",

      "response": {
        "success": true,
        "content": "Your children may be eligible for VA benefits under certain conditions:\n\n- For CHAMPVA coverage, children of a Veteran can be covered if the Veteran is permanently and totally disabled due to service-connected conditions, was rated so at the time of death, died due to a service-connected condition, or died on active duty with dependents not eligible for TRICARE. Children must be aged 0-17, 18-23 if enrolled in school, or 18+ if a helpless child due to disability before age 18. Children who marry will lose eligibility for CHAMPVA\u00b9.\n\n- For Dependents Educational Assistance (DEA) benefits, children must be dependents of a Veteran and eligible for any VA education benefit\u00b3. Eligibility depends on when the event making the child eligible occurred and the child's age and schooling status:\n  - If the event happened before August 1, 2023, and the child turned 18 and completed high school before that date, they must be between 18 and 26 years old to get DEA benefits. Marriage does not end eligibility in this case\u00b2.\n  - If the event happened on or after August 1, 2023, or the child turned 18 or completed high school on or after that date, the benefit does not expire. However, children attending approved high schools can use DEA benefits for up to 5 months until August 1, 2026\u00b2\u2076.\n\n- Children may also be eligible for Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) as surviving children if they are unmarried, not included on the surviving spouse's compensation, and are under 18, under 23 if attending school, or permanently incapable of self-support due to disability before age 18. If a child marries, they generally lose DIC entitlement unless the marriage ends and was after October 31, 1990\u2077.\n\n- To apply for education benefits, the dependent child must apply from their own account and obtain a Certificate of Eligibility to present to their school's Certifying Official\u2074.\n\nIn summary, your children can get VA benefits if they meet the specific eligibility criteria related to age, schooling, marital status, and the Veteran's service-connected disability or death status.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Eligibility - CHAMPVA](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/champva#eligibility)  \n\u00b2 [Eligibility Requirements for Dependent Children (Historical)](https://veteransbenefitskb.com)  \n\u00b3 [Eligibility - Survivor Benefits](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/survivorbenefits#top)  \n\u2074 [Applying - Survivor Benefits](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/survivorbenefits#top)  \n\u2076 [Eligibility Requirements for Dependent Children and Spouses](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/ears)  \n\u2077 [Children - Dependents](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/dependents#helpless)",

This includes periods of Active Duty for Training (ADT), Inactive Duty Training (IADT), drill weekends, or any other training while on orders, as well as traveling directly to or from their place of duty. To properly file a disability claim, reservists should have their unit issue a Line of Duty (LOD) determination or a Notice of Eligibility (NOE) if in the U.S. Coast Guard Reserve. If a LOD/NOE is not obtained, they may rely on buddy letters or personal statements as evidence. Additionally, having pre- and post-deployment physicals can support the claim if accurate and complete.\n\nFurthermore, eligibility for certain benefits related to reservists includes having had Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance (SGLI) while on duty and suffering an injury or disability that disqualified them for standard premium insurance rates, or being within specific time frames related to release from active duty or reserve status\u00b3\u2074.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [National Guard/Reserves - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vaclaim#top)  \n\u00b2 [Eligibility - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/upgrade)  \n\u00b3 [Eligibility - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/ears)  \n\u2074 [Eligibility - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/ears)",

This coverage also includes traveling directly to or from their place of duty. To properly file a disability claim, they should have their unit issue a Line of Duty (LOD) determination or a Notice of Eligibility (NOE) if in the U.S. Coast Guard Reserve. If they do not obtain an LOD/NOE, they will need to rely on buddy letters or personal statements as evidence. Pre- and post-deployment physicals can also serve as evidence if accurate and complete\u00b9.\n\nAdditionally, eligibility for VA disability benefits requires that the disability is chronic and related to military service, the character of discharge is honorable (or possibly general under honorable), and the service included Active Duty, ADT, or IADT, which applies to National Guard members as well\u00b3.\n\nFurthermore, eligibility conditions include being within certain time frames related to release or retirement from the National Guard or Ready Reserves\u00b2.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [National Guard/Reserves - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vaclaim#top)  \n\u00b2 [Eligibility - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/ears)  \n\u00b3 [Eligibility - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/upgrade)",

The VA can obtain your VA medical records themselves, so it is not necessary to upload them as part of your claim. However, if you have private medical records or non-VA hospital reports related to your claimed condition, you should provide them or give the VA a VA Form 21-4142/21-4142a to obtain those records for you. \n\nAdditionally, before filing a claim, you must have at least these three parts:\n\n- A statement of symptoms or current diagnosis.\n- An in-service event or service-connected disability that caused or worsened your condition.\n- A nexus (a layman would think the first two are related).\n\nIf your claim does not have all three parts, it will be denied without even being sent to a Compensation & Pension Exam (C&P)\u00b9\u2074\u2075.\n\nSo while medical records are not strictly required to file a claim, you do need sufficient evidence and statements to support your claim, and providing medical records can help establish your case.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n\u00b9 [Miscellaneous Evidence - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)  \n\u00b2 [BARE MINIMUM You Need BEFORE You File a Claim: - (references)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vaclaim)",
