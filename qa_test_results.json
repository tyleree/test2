        "content": "To file a VA disability claim, you have several options:\n\n- File online yourself at VA.gov by completing the claim form (VA Form 21-526EZ) available [here](https://www.va.gov/disability/how-to-file-claim/) or directly submit the form [here](https://eauth.va.gov/accessva/?cspSelectFor=quicksubmit).\n- File with the assistance of a Veterans Service Officer (VSO), who can help you prepare and submit your claim. You can find a VSO near you [here](https://www.va.gov/ogc/apps/accreditation/index.asp).\n- File by fax at 844-531-7818.\n- File in person by submitting the completed VA Form 21-526EZ to your nearest VA Regional Office.\n- File by mail by sending the completed VA Form 21-526EZ to:\n\n  ```\n  Department of Veterans Affairs\n  Claims Intake Center\n  PO Box 4444\n  Janesville, WI 53547-4444\n  ```\n\nImportant notes:\n\n- If you file a new claim while another claim is active, the VA will close the newly filed claim automatically but will eventually combine your new issues with the older active claim.\n- The VA uses the date the claim is processed by the intake center, not the postmark date, to establish the effective date of your claim.\n- If you are filing a Fully Developed Claim (BDD), you must sign the claim paperwork yourself if it is your first claim.\n- You do not need to have a diagnosis to file a claim.\n\nIt is strongly recommended to use a VSO to assist with filing your claim to ensure it is done correctly\u00b3\u2074.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Filing a VA Disability Claim](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vaclaim)  \n\u00b2 [Filing a BDD Claim](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vaclaim)  \n\u00b3 [Filing a Claim](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vaclaim)  \n\u2074 [How to File](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals)",

It is used to evaluate the severity and service connection of a Veteran's claimed disabilities.

After submitting a claim, Veterans can expect to be scheduled for a C&P exam, although in some cases, it may take several months or may not be scheduled at all. It is important for Veterans to keep their contact information up-to-date to avoid missing notices about their exam\u00b9\u2075.\n\nAdditionally, to understand how a C&P exam will be conducted, Veterans are encouraged to review the applicable Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ), which outlines the criteria and examination process for specific conditions.

This will give you an idea of what the exam will cover and how it will be conducted. You can find DBQs for various conditions such as cervical spine, thoracolumbar spine, traumatic brain injury (TBI), cranial nerve conditions, arthritis, fibromyalgia, osteomyelitis, breast conditions, and gynecological conditions\u00b3\u2074\u2075\u2076\u2077.\n\n- If you want, you may ask your treating physician to complete a DBQ on your behalf to submit with your claim. This can help provide detailed medical information to the VA\u2076.\n\n- You can include a personal statement with your request if you want to use a specific contractor or VA medical center for your exam, or if you prefer a tele-health appointment for your mental health exam. The VA will attempt to honor these requests if reasonable and possible\u00b9.\n\n- Keep your mailing address, email address, and phone number up-to-date with the VA to ensure you receive notice of your exam appointment\u2074.\n\n- Be prepared that the exam may be scheduled shortly after you file your claim, but sometimes it may take several months or you may not get one at all\u2074.\n\nThese steps will help you be better prepared for your C&P exam.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n\u00b9 [Compensation & Pension Examinations (C&P)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/cnp)  \n\u00b2 [Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQs) - Cervical Spine](https://www.benefits.va.gov/compensation/docs/Neck_Conditions_Cervical_Spine.pdf)  \n\u00b3 [Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQs) - TBI (OLD)](https://www.dcms.uscg.mil/Portals/10/CG-1/PSC/PSD/docs/VBA%20-%20Initial%20evaluation%20of%20TBI%20residuals.pdf?ver=2017-03-28-105323-973)  \n\u2074 [After Submitting a Claim](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vaclaim)  \n\u2075 [Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQs) - Cranial Nerve Conditions](https://www.benefits.va.gov/compensation/docs/Cranial_Nerve_Conditions.pdf)  \n\u2076 [Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQs) - Arthritis, Fibromyalgia, Osteomyelitis](https://www.benefits.va.gov/compensation/docs/Arthritis.pdf)  \n\u2077 [Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQs) - Breast and Gynecological Conditions](https://www.benefits.va.gov/compensation/docs/Breast_Conditions.pdf)",

        "success": true,
        "content": "An Intent to File is the first step in filing a VA disability claim. It is important because it preserves your effective date, which determines when you start receiving payments from the VA. For recently separated veterans, an Intent to File can be automatically opened the day after separation, and if filed before the one-year separation anniversary, it allows up to an additional year to submit the claim while still receiving back pay from the day after separation\u00b9.\n\nAn Intent to File can be submitted in several ways, including online at VA.gov, through a Veterans Service Officer (VSO), by phone, in person using VA Form 21-0966, by fax, or by mail. The VA uses the date the Intent to File is processed, not the postmark date, to establish the effective date. An Intent to File is valid for one year and can be used for one claim, although that claim can cover multiple conditions. If multiple claims or appeals are filed on the same day, they all share the same Intent to File\u00b2.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Intent to File - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vaclaim)  \n\u00b2 [Starting an Intent to File - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vaclaim)",

        "success": true,
        "content": "Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD) is a VA program that allows active duty servicemembers who are between 180 and 90 days before separation to file a disability claim within that window. The goal of BDD is to enable the claim to be processed and a decision to be made by the day after the veteran separates from active duty. This program is designed to give the claim a head start before separation, although it is not guaranteed that a decision will be made immediately upon separation.\n\nKey points about BDD include:\n\n- You must submit your Service Treatment Records (STRs) no later than 90 days before separation to remain in the BDD program.\n- Private medical records are not automatically included in STRs and must be added by the veteran.\n- You do not need to complete all exams before separation or before the 90-day window closes.\n- Keeping the VA updated on your location is important for receiving notifications about examinations.\n- If you have less than 90 days before separation, you can still file a claim, but it may not be processed under BDD.\n- Veterans can file BDD claims online themselves or with assistance from a Veterans Service Officer (VSO).\n- You do not need a diagnosis to file a claim under BDD.\n\nBDD is intended to streamline the disability claims process for servicemembers transitioning out of active duty, ideally providing a faster decision on their claims right after separation\u00b9\u2074\u00b2.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD) - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/digsystem)  \n\u00b2 [Filing a BDD Claim - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vaclaim)  \n\u2074 [Active Duty Servicemembers - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/cnp)",

For example, if a claim was denied due to lack of diagnosis, submitting evidence of a diagnosis would be relevant.\n\nNew and relevant evidence can include:\n\n- Being seen by a doctor for the claimed issue(s)\n- A new theory of service connection (such as claiming the condition was caused by another service-connected disability)\n- Evidence related to presumptive conditions\n- Willingness to attend new VA examinations if previously missed\n- Independent medical opinions or nexus letters\n- Disability Benefits Questionnaires (DBQs)\n- Personal or buddy statements\n\nVeterans have **1 year** from the decision on their claim to file a supplemental claim to potentially keep their back pay. It is recommended to wait until enough evidence is gathered before filing. Supplemental claims are reviewed by a VA rater, and it is typical to receive new exams or medical opinions when filing a supplemental claim, provided the new evidence properly addresses the denial rationale.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n\u00b9 [Supplemental Claim (20-0995)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals#995)  \n\u00b2 [Supplemental Claim - (appeals)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals#supplementalclaim)",

One way to do this is by submitting a Supplemental Claim, which allows you to provide new and relevant evidence that was not previously considered. New evidence can include new medical records, a new diagnosis, an independent medical opinion (IMO)/nexus letter, personal or buddy statements, or willingness to attend a new exam if you missed a previous one. You have 1 year from the decision on your claim to file an appeal and submit this additional evidence. If you believe the VA did not properly evaluate your evidence, you might also consider filing a Higher-Level Review (HLR). If an error is found during HLR that requires new evidence, your HLR may be administratively closed and reopened as a supplemental claim, allowing you to submit new evidence.  \n\nIt is important not to file a new claim for a condition that was previously denied or a similar condition, as this will likely be rejected and you will be directed to appeal instead.  \n\nIn summary, reopening a denied claim is done through an appeal process such as a Supplemental Claim or HLR, with the opportunity to submit new and relevant evidence to support your case\u00b3\u2074\u2075\u2076\u2077.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Supplemental Claim (20-0995)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals#995)  \n\u00b2 [Denied Service-Connection - (appeals)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals#deniedserviceconnection)  \n\u00b3 [Denied Service-Connection - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals)  \n\u2074 [BEFORE Filing a Claim for a New Disability](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vaclaim)  \n\u2075 [Filing an Appeal - FAQ](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals#faq)  \n\u2076 [Filing an Appeal - FAQ](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals#faq)",

        "content": "Aggravation in the context of VA disability claims refers to the worsening of a condition due to military service or a service-connected condition. There are two types of aggravation:\n\n1. Aggravation of a preexisting (pre-service) condition by military service.\n2. Aggravation of an existing (post-service) condition by a service-connected condition.\n\nThis means if a condition you had before or after service gets worse because of your military service or a service-connected disability, that worsening can be considered for service connection under aggravation\u00b9.\n\nTo establish aggravation, the VA must determine the level of severity of the condition before and after the aggravation. Medical evidence showing the severity before aggravation is required to prove how much the condition worsened due to service or a service-connected condition\u00b2.\n\nRating of aggravated conditions involves subtracting the severity of the preexisting condition from the current severity to determine the aggravated rating. For preexisting conditions, if the condition was rated 100% before aggravation, the final rating remains 100%. This does not apply to aggravations of conditions after separation from service\u00b3.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Service-Connection by Aggravation](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/agg#serviceconnectionbyaggravation)  \n\u00b2 [Aggravation of an Existing (Post-service) Condition](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/agg#aggravationofanexistingpostservicecondition)  \n\u00b3 [Rating Aggravated Conditions](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/agg#ratingaggravatedconditions)",

To strengthen your claim, you can submit additional evidence such as:\n\n- An Independent Medical Opinion (IMO) or Nexus letter linking your disability to service.\n- Personal statements explaining your condition and its connection to service.\n- Buddy statements from fellow service members who can attest to your in-service injury or symptoms.\n\nIf you were denied because you missed a VA exam, you can file a supplemental claim and state that you are willing and able to attend exams at this time.\n\nIf you believe the VA did not properly evaluate your evidence, you may consider filing a Higher-Level Review (HLR) to have a different rater review your claim.\n\nThese steps help establish and prove service connection for your disability claim.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Denied Service-Connection - (appeals)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals#deniedserviceconnection)  \n\u00b2 [Denied Service-Connection - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals)",

      "response": {
        "success": true,
        "content": "A Higher-Level Review (HLR) is an entirely new review of your VA disability claim conducted by an experienced, more senior rater known as a Decision Review Officer (DRO). This review involves re-examining the evidence already in the record but does **not** allow for the submission or consideration of any new evidence received after the original decision was made. The DRO has the authority to issue a \"difference of opinion,\" meaning they can weigh the existing evidence differently and potentially reach a more favorable outcome for the veteran. However, such differences of opinion cannot result in a negative outcome for the veteran. If the previous decision contained Clear and Unmistakable Errors (CUEs), those errors can be corrected even if the correction results in a negative outcome, with appropriate due notice.\n\nAdditional important points about Higher-Level Review include:\n\n- Veterans cannot file back-to-back HLRs but can alternate between HLRs and supplemental claims.\n- Veterans cannot request an HLR after a Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA) denial.\n- The HLR must be submitted within one year of the decision being reviewed.\n- Intent to file does not apply to HLRs.\n\nIn summary, an HLR is a senior rater's fresh look at your claim based on the existing evidence, aiming to correct any errors or differences in opinion without considering new evidence\u00b9\u00b3.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Higher-Level Review (HLR 20-0996)](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-20-0996-ARE.pdf)  \n\u00b3 [Higher-Level Review - (appeals)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals#higherlevelreview)",

        "content": "A Supplemental Claim is an opportunity for a veteran to submit **new and relevant** evidence to the VA to support their claim for disability benefits. \"New\" means the VA did not previously have or consider the evidence, and \"relevant\" means the evidence directly addresses the reason for the denial of the claim. For example, if a claim was denied due to lack of diagnosis, submitting evidence of a diagnosis would be relevant.\n\nNew and relevant evidence can include:\n\n- Being seen by a doctor for the claimed issue(s)\n- A new theory of service connection (such as claiming the condition was caused by another service-connected disability)\n- Evidence related to presumptive conditions\n- Willingness to attend new VA examinations if previously missed\n- Independent medical opinions or nexus letters\n- Disability Benefits Questionnaires (DBQs)\n- Personal statements or buddy statements\n\nVeterans have 1 year from the date of the claim's decision to file a Supplemental Claim to potentially preserve their effective date for back pay. It is recommended to wait until enough evidence is gathered before filing. The Supplemental Claim can be submitted online, by paper, through a Veterans Service Organization (VSO) or lawyer, in person, or by mail. The VA will not consider the postmark date but the date the claim is processed by the VA's intake center, so timely submission is critical.\n\nTypically, filing a Supplemental Claim may result in new VA exams or medical opinions, but these will only be ordered if the new evidence properly addresses the reason for the denial.\n\nIn summary, a Supplemental Claim is a formal way to provide additional evidence to support a denied claim within a year of the decision, aiming to get the claim granted or increased based on this new information\u00b3\u2076.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n\u00b9 [Supplemental Claim (20-0995)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals#995)  \n\u00b2 [Supplemental Claim - (appeals)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals#supplementalclaim)  \n\u00b3 [Submitting a Supplemental Claim - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals#995)  \n\u2076 [Filing an Appeal - FAQ - (faq)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals#faq)",

These judges are not bound by VA Central Office policy decisions and have the authority to issue grants that VA raters cannot, which means their decisions can sometimes contradict VA policies. The BVA appeal process typically takes years to complete and is usually chosen after other appeal options like Supplemental Claim or Higher Level Review have been exhausted. Veterans must submit their appeal to the BVA within one year of their claim's decision and cannot request a BVA appeal after receiving a BVA decision for the same claimed issue consecutively.\n\nThere are three lanes or appeal dockets a veteran can choose when appealing to the BVA:\n\n1. Direct Review \u2013 a judge reviews the claim without new evidence.\n2. Evidence Submission \u2013 allows submission of new evidence for the judge to review.\n3. Hearing \u2013 the veteran can have a hearing before a Veterans Law Judge.\n\nThe BVA judges review the case and issue decisions that may grant benefits or deny the claim based on their interpretation of the law and evidence presented.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Board Veterans' Appeals (BVA) AKA, Notice of Disagreement (NOD), AKA](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals)  \n\u00b2 [Board Veterans' Appeals (BVA) AKA, Notice of Disagreement (NOD), AKA - (appeals)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals#boardveteransappealsbvaakanoticeofdisagreementnodaka)",

Our internal confidence score is **49.6%** for this response - please verify the answer with your own due diligence. A report has been generated and someone will review this.\n\nThe provided context does not explicitly define or explain the difference between legacy and AMA (Appeals Modernization Act) appeals. However, it does mention that the \"legacy appeal\" process is the older appeals system, and there is an option to convert or \"opt-in\" from legacy appeals to the modern appeal processes (AMA). This opt-in box only applies to veterans who have been in a continuous appeal since around 2017; otherwise, it can be ignored\u00b9.\n\nIn summary:\n- Legacy appeals refer to the older, traditional appeals system.\n- AMA appeals refer to the modernized appeals process introduced after 2017.\n- Veterans in legacy appeals can choose to convert their appeal to the AMA process by opting in on the supplemental claim form, but this only applies if they have been in continuous appeal since about 2017\u00b9.\n\nNo further details about the procedural or substantive differences between legacy and AMA appeals are provided in the context.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Filing an Appeal - FAQ](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals#faq)",

      "response": {
        "success": true,
        "content": "VA disability ratings are calculated based on the severity of a Veteran's service-connected condition(s) as determined by the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) using the Schedule for Rating Disabilities in conjunction with the M21-1 Adjudication Procedures Manual. The rating percentage reflects how much the disability impairs the Veteran's ability to function and is intended to compensate for the average impairment in earning capacity caused by the disability.\n\nFor mental health conditions, the rating is determined by evaluating the totality of symptoms and evidence submitted, including C&P examiner reports, Disability Benefits Questionnaires (DBQs), nexus letters, buddy letters, personal statements, treatment notes, and other relevant documentation. The rater assigns a rating percentage that most closely matches the overall severity of the Veteran's symptoms, not necessarily requiring all symptoms listed for a particular rating level to be present\u00b9\u00b3.\n\nEach condition is assigned a diagnostic code (DC) that corresponds to specific rating criteria. For example, PTSD is under DC 9411, hypertension under DC 7101, and tinnitus under DC 6260\u00b9.\n\nThe combined disability rating is calculated when a Veteran has multiple service-connected disabilities, and this combined rating determines eligibility for various benefits such as Individual Unemployability, nursing home care, and other programs. For example, a combined rating of 70% or more may qualify a Veteran for Individual Unemployability and certain health care benefits\u00b2.\n\nIt is important not to misuse or misrepresent the severity of a condition on the rating schedule, as this is considered a crime. The rating schedule should be used as a guide to understand how the VA evaluates disabilities and what evidence is relevant to support a claim\u2074\u2075.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Common VA Diagnostic Codes Reference](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/ratingsindex)  \n\u00b2 [70%](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/combinedbenefits)  \n\u00b3 [How a Rater Decides](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/cnp)  \n\u2074 [The Rating Schedule Index](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/ratingsindex)  \n\u2075 [The Rating Schedule Index](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/ratingsindex)",

        "content": "The difference between schedular and TDIU (Total Disability Individual Unemployability) lies in how the VA rates a veteran's disability and the impact on their ability to work:\n\n- **Schedular Rating:** This is the disability rating assigned based on the severity of the veteran's service-connected conditions according to the VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities. It reflects the level of impairment but does not necessarily consider the veteran's ability to maintain gainful employment\u00b9.\n\n- **TDIU (Total Disability based on Individual Unemployability):** This is a special VA benefit that allows veterans who are unable to hold down substantially gainful employment due to their service-connected disabilities to be compensated at the 100% disability rate, even if their combined schedular rating is less than 100%. To qualify for TDIU, a veteran must have at least one service-connected disability rated at 60% or higher and be unable to maintain steady employment because of their disabilities. Marginal or odd jobs do not disqualify a veteran from TDIU\u00b2. TDIU is meant to compensate for the economic impact of the disability on employability rather than just the medical severity.\n\nIn summary, schedular ratings are based on medical severity, while TDIU considers the veteran's inability to work due to service-connected disabilities and provides 100% compensation accordingly.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Unemployability - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/IU)  \n\u00b2 [50% - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/IU)",

It can provide benefits ranging from over $100 to over $10,000 monthly. For example, veterans who need regular aid and attendance due to a service-connected condition such as traumatic brain injury (TBI) may qualify for SMC.

If they find a Clear and Unmistakable Error (CUE) where you were rated too high or service-connection was granted in error, they will take action to correct it, which can include reducing your rating\u00b9.\n- If exams ordered as part of your claim show that your condition has improved, the VA can start action to reduce your rating\u00b9.\n- However, a single Compensation & Pension (C&P) exam showing improvement is generally not enough to reduce a rating if the evaluation has been held for at least 5 continuous years. Continuous improvement must be shown, usually requiring more than one exam showing improvement before a proposal for reduction is issued. There are exceptions, such as conditions rated based on lab results (e.g., kidney or lung function), where a single exam can trigger a reduction if it confirms improvement and you filed for an increase on that condition\u00b2\u00b3.\n- The 5-year protection against reduction does not reset, meaning the VA can still reduce your rating based on improvement even after many years if evidence supports it\u00b2\u00b3.\n\nIn summary, your rating can be reduced if there is a clear error or if your condition improves continuously, but there are protections in place to prevent reductions based on a single exam if your rating has been stable for 5 years or more.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Filing an Appeal - FAQ](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals#faq)  \n\u00b2 [5 Years - Reductions (38 CFR 3.344) - references](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/ears)  \n\u00b3 [5 Years - Reductions (38 CFR 3.344) - references](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/ratingsindex#protection)",

Our internal confidence score is **48.3%** for this response - please verify the answer with your own due diligence. A report has been generated and someone will review this.\n\nA protected rating refers to a VA disability rating that cannot be reduced for a certain period of time once it has been held continuously. According to the example involving rating increases:\n\n- A rating that has been held for 5 years is protected from reduction for that 5-year period.\n- A rating held for 10 years also gains protection.\n- A rating held for 20 years is protected as well.\n\nHowever, if a rating is increased, the protection applies only to the original rating percentage that has been held for the required time, not to the newly increased rating. For example, if a condition was rated 10% for 10 years and then increased to 30%, the 10% rating has 20-year protection, but the 30% rating does not immediately gain the same protection until it is held for the required time period.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Example Involving Increase - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/ratingsindex#protection)  \n\u00b2 [Example Involving Increase - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/ears)",

This means the condition is considered stable and unlikely to improve or worsen, so the rating remains fixed unless there is a clear error or new evidence. Static conditions are not expected to be reevaluated by the VA over time.\n\nIn contrast, a dynamic rating applies to conditions that may change over time and are subject to periodic reevaluation. These conditions can improve or worsen, so the VA may schedule future exams to adjust the disability rating accordingly.\n\nYou can find which of your conditions are static or dynamic through online tools or by requesting your C-File, which includes a code sheet listing all conditions and their static status\u00b9\u00b3\u2074.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Static vs Dynamic Ratings - FAQ](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/static-check#faq)  \n\u00b3 [Static vs Dynamic Ratings - (rating_info)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/static-check#staticvsdynamicratings)  \n\u2074 [Static vs Dynamic Ratings - FAQ](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/static-check#faq)",

Please verify key statistics with official VA documentation.\n\nP&T (Permanent and Total) refers to a disability rating status where a veteran is rated 100% disabled permanently and totally. This status provides several benefits including:\n\n- Entitlement to Chapter 35 Dependents Educational Assistance (DEA).\n- Removal of the 10% penalty for early withdrawal of 401K and IRAs.\n- Eligibility for the veteran's dependents to enroll in CHAMPVA (Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs).\n- During a medical emergency, the veteran may freely use non-VA emergency rooms for any condition and must submit a claim within 2 years for reimbursement.\n- Expedited processing of the veteran's disability claims through Social Security.\n- Free air travel on Space-A, which can be used by the veteran's dependents if the veteran accompanies them. This travel includes flights within the Continental United States and between CONUS and certain U.S. territories and states.\n\nThese benefits highlight the comprehensive support provided to veterans with a Permanent and Total disability rating\u00b9.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [100% P&T or TDIU P&T - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/IU)",

A report has been generated and someone will review this.\n\nThe 5 year rule refers to the protection a Veteran has against rating reductions based on a single Compensation & Pension (C&P) exam showing improvement. Specifically:\n\n- A Veteran's rating generally cannot be reduced based on just one exam that shows the disability has improved.\n- Continuous improvement must be demonstrated over a period of at least 5 continuous years before a reduction can be proposed.\n- In most cases, the VA will require another exam confirming the continued improvement before issuing a proposal for reduction if the reduction affects the combined evaluation.\n- If the reduction does not affect the combined evaluation, the condition may be reduced without notice.\n- This protection does not reset after 5 years. For example, if an exam shows improvement at year 6 and another at year 16, the VA can still pursue a reduction based on these findings.\n- There are exceptions for conditions rated based on lab results or those with temporary or episodic improvement.\n\nIn summary, the 5 year rule means that a Veteran's disability rating is protected from reduction unless continuous improvement is shown over at least 5 years.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [5 Years - Reductions (38 CFR 3.344) - (references)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/ears)\n\u00b2 [5 Years - Reductions (38 CFR 3.344) - (references)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/ratingsindex#protection)",

        "content": "PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) is rated by the VA as a mental health disorder based on the severity of the totality of the Veteran's symptoms, not on the specific diagnosis itself. Veterans receive a single mental health rating regardless of the number of diagnoses they have, including PTSD\u00b9 \u2077.\n\nPTSD does have unique service-connection criteria requiring an in-service stressor, which can include various traumatic events such as combat exposure, assault, military sexual trauma, accidents, and others\u00b3. However, once service-connected, PTSD is rated using the same general mental health rating criteria as other mental disorders\u00b9.\n\nThe rating percentage is determined by how closely the Veteran's symptoms match the criteria for each rating level. For example, a 50% rating corresponds to occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity due to symptoms such as panic attacks more than once a week, difficulty understanding complex commands, impaired judgment, disturbances of mood, and difficulty maintaining effective work and social relationships\u00b2.\n\nAdditionally, PTSD and TBI (Traumatic Brain Injury) symptoms often overlap and may be \"lumped\" together for rating purposes, but if the symptoms can be clearly separated by a specialist, separate ratings for each condition can be assigned\u2074.\n\nIn summary:\n\n- PTSD is rated as a mental disorder based on symptom severity, not diagnosis alone\u00b9 \u2077.\n- Service-connection for PTSD requires an in-service stressor\u00b3.\n- Ratings reflect the overall impact of symptoms on occupational and social functioning, with specific symptom examples defining rating levels such as 50%\u00b2.\n- PTSD and TBI may be rated together or separately depending on symptom differentiation\u2074.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Mental Disorder Ratings](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)  \n\u00b2 [50% - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)  \n\u00b3 [PTSD Service-Connection](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)  \n\u2074 [PTSD & TBI - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)  \n\u2077 [Mental Disorders - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)",

        "content": "Anxiety is rated based on the severity of the totality of a Veteran's symptoms rather than the specific diagnosis. Veterans receive a single rating regardless of the number of mental health diagnoses they have. The rating depends on how symptoms affect occupational and social functioning, work efficiency, and daily life.\n\nHere are some example rating levels for anxiety symptoms:\n\n- **10% rating:** Occupational and social impairment due to mild or transient symptoms that decrease work efficiency only during significant stress or symptoms controlled by continuous medication. Symptoms include mild anxiety, occasional mild panic attacks, and occasional sleep disturbances. The Veteran is always able to care for themselves and rarely has work problems\u00b9\u00b3.\n\n- **30% rating:** Occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent inability to perform occupational tasks. Symptoms include depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, weekly or less frequent panic attacks, chronic sleep impairment, and mild memory loss. The Veteran can usually care for themselves but may occasionally be hospitalized. Social relationships may be strained\u00b9\u2075.\n\n- **50% rating:** Occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity. Symptoms include flattened affect, frequent panic attacks (more than once a week), difficulty understanding complex commands, impaired memory and judgment, disturbances of motivation and mood, and difficulty maintaining relationships. The Veteran is mostly able to care for themselves but may have hygiene issues and difficulty maintaining employment long-term\u00b9\u2076.\n\nThe Veteran's formal diagnosis (e.g., generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, PTSD) does not affect the rating level; the rating is based on symptom severity and functional impairment\u00b9\u2074.\n\n**Sources:**",

It ranges from mild or transient symptoms that only decrease work efficiency during significant stress, with occasional social issues, to total impairment where the individual is unable to work or maintain social relationships and may require constant hospitalization due to being a danger to themselves or others.\n\n- Mild occupational and social impairment involves symptoms such as mild anxiety or depression, occasional panic attacks, and occasional sleep disturbances. The person is always able to care for themselves, rarely has problems working, and may have occasional social issues. Symptoms may be controlled by continuous medication\u00b9.\n\n- Total occupational and social impairment includes gross impairment in thought processes or communication, persistent delusions or hallucinations, inappropriate behavior, persistent danger to self or others, inability to perform daily living activities, disorientation, and significant memory loss. The person is unable to care for themselves, cannot work, and does not participate in social relationships.

A Veteran receives a single combined rating for all mental health disorders, except for eating disorders which are rated separately\u00b9. \n\nThe rating decision considers a wide array of evidence, including:\n\n- Compensation & Pension (C&P) examiner's report\n- Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ)\n- Nexus letters\n- Buddy letters and personal statements\n- Supporting statements for PTSD claims\n- Private and VA treatment notes\n- Vet Center notes (with written permission)\n\nThe rater assesses the totality of symptoms and evidence to assign a rating percentage that most closely matches the Veteran's overall symptom severity. It is not necessary to meet every example symptom for a particular rating; the overall impact on occupational and social functioning is key\u00b2.\n\nFor example, a 50% rating corresponds to occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity due to symptoms such as panic attacks more than once a week, difficulty understanding complex commands, impaired judgment, and disturbances of motivation and mood. The Veteran may be mostly able to care for themselves but have difficulty maintaining employment and social relationships\u2074.\n\nHonesty during the C&P examination is critical, but exaggeration or fabrication should be avoided\u00b3.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Mental Disorder Ratings - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)  \n\u00b2 [How a Rater Decides - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/cnp)  \n\u00b3 [Mental Disorders - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)  \n\u2074 [50% - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)",

        "success": true,
        "content": "Back pain is generally rated by the VA based on the limitation of Range of Motion (ROM) of the spine, rather than the specific diagnosis of the back condition. The rating focuses on the Veteran\u2019s limitation in either the neck (cervical spine) or the rest of the back (thoracolumbar spine). The examiner and rater must consider flare-ups and estimate the impairment on the Veteran\u2019s worst day, using the most impaired ROM measurements noted during the exam\u00b9.\n\nThe VA uses specific criteria for rating based on ROM measurements. For the thoracolumbar (lower and middle) back, the ratings are assigned as follows based on forward flexion and combined ROM:\n\n- 0% rating: Forward flexion measures 90\u00b0 or more, or combined ROM measures 240\u00b0 or more.\n- 10% rating: Forward flexion measures more than 60\u00b0 but not more than 85\u00b0, or combined ROM is between 125\u00b0 and 240\u00b0.\n- Higher ratings correspond to more severe limitations, but the exact values beyond 10% are not provided in the context\u00b3.\n\nAdditionally, if pain with motion is present, the VA may assign a rating for pain with motion, but only a single rating under range of motion is awarded regardless of how many ranges of motion are impacted\u2076.\n\nVeterans can receive separate ratings for the neck and the thoracolumbar spine, but only one rating per section of the spine even if multiple conditions affect that section\u00b3.\n\nIf arthritis is involved and does not meet rating criteria based on ROM, the condition may be rated under degenerative arthritis instead\u2074.\n\nIn summary, back pain is rated primarily based on the limitation of range of motion of the spine, with consideration of flare-ups and pain with motion, and separate ratings may be given for the neck and lower/middle back sections\u00b9\u00b3\u2076.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [(Back and Neck) - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/spine)  \n\u00b3 [DC 5235 - through 5242 Ratings Based Off Limitations of Range of Motion - (rating_table)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/nervesystem#5235)  \n\u2074 [Arthritis of the Spine - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/spine)  \n\u2076 [Pain with Motion - (rating_table)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/hip)",

These categories are represented by Roman numerals, where a higher numeral indicates worse hearing.\n\n- After categorizing each ear, the VA uses a rating table that compares the \"worst ear\" and the \"best ear\" categories to assign a final disability rating percentage.\n\n- To be eligible for any rating (greater than 0%), the hearing loss must meet at least one of these criteria:\n  - Auditory threshold of 40 decibels or greater at any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz.\n  - Auditory thresholds of 26 decibels or greater at at least three of those frequencies.\n  - Speech recognition scores less than 94 percent.\n\n- If only one ear is service-connected and the other is not, the VA can consider the non-service-connected ear as service-connected for rating purposes if:\n  - The non-service-connected ear was not due to willful misconduct.\n  - The non-service-connected ear has hearing loss for VA purposes.\n  - The service-connected ear rates at least 10% by itself.\n\n- The final rating is assigned based on the combined evaluation of both ears using the rating table, which assigns percentages from 0% up to 100% depending on the severity of hearing loss in both ears.\n\n- If only the puretone test was done, a separate puretone-only table is used to determine the severity for each ear.\n\n- The VA does not assign separate ratings for each ear but considers both ears together to assign a single combined rating.\n\n- If an ear is not service-connected, it is considered to have perfect hearing (100% working order) for rating purposes unless special conditions apply.\n\n- Hearing aids must be removed before testing to ensure accurate results.\n\nThis method ensures a comprehensive evaluation of hearing impairment by considering both ears' hearing ability and speech understanding to assign an appropriate disability rating\u00b3.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Rating Table - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/ears)  \n\u00b2 [DC 6100 - Hearing Loss - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/ears#6100)  \n\u00b3 [Puretone and Speech Discrimination Table - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/ears)",

        "content": "Scars are rated by the VA based on several factors including their location, size, characteristics, and associated symptoms such as pain or instability. The rating process involves different diagnostic codes and formulas depending on the type and location of the scars:\n\n- **Location-Based Rating:**\n  - Scars involving the head, face, or neck are rated under DC 7800, which considers visible or palpable disfigurement and specific characteristics such as length, width, attachment to underlying tissue, color changes, texture abnormalities, and underlying soft tissue loss\u00b9.\n  - Scars not involving the head, face, or neck are divided into six body areas (torso front, back, left arm, right arm, left leg, right leg). Each area can be rated separately, or combined if it results in a higher rating\u00b9.\n\n- **Type of Scar:**\n  - Superficial scars (affecting only the skin) are rated under DC 7802, with a 10% rating if the scars cover 144 square inches or more\u00b2.\n  - Painful or unstable scars are rated under DC 7804. If scars are painful when touched (not just self-reported) or unstable (frequent loss of skin covering), an additional rating of 10% can be added. The rating depends on the number of scars: 10% for 1-2 scars, 20% for 3-4 scars, and 30% for 5 or more scars\u00b2.\n  - Other scars are rated under DC 7805, which captures impairments not covered by other specific codes\u2074.\n\n- **Additional Considerations:**\n  - If scars cause range of motion issues, a separate rating for that impairment can be granted\u00b9.\n  - Bilateral factor consideration applies to scars not involving the head, face, or neck, provided the ratings are not based on whole-body involvement, are 10% or higher, and not specific to the head, face, or neck\u00b9.\n  - Ratings may be combined or \"pyramided\" if it results in a higher overall rating\u00b9.\n\n- **General Rating Formula for Skin Conditions:**\n  - For skin conditions with lesions, ratings are based on the percentage of total body or exposed areas covered and the type and duration of therapy required. Ratings range from 0% to 60% depending on severity and treatment needs\u00b3.\n\nIn summary, scars are rated based on their location, size, number, pain or instability, and any functional impairment they cause, using specific diagnostic codes and rating criteria to determine the appropriate disability percentage.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Scars NOT Involving the Head, Face, or Neck - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/skin)  \n\u00b2 [DC 7804 - Painful or Unstable Scars - (rating_table)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/skin#7804)  \n\u00b3 [General Rating Formula For The Skin - (rating_table)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/skin)  \n\u2074 [DC 7805 - All other Scars - (condition_definition)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/skin#7805)  \n\u2075 [DC 7800 - Scars and Disfigurement Involving the Head, Face, or Neck - (rating_table)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/skin#7800)  \n\u2076 [DC 7802 - Superficial Scars - (rating_table)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/skin#7802)",

        "content": "TBI symptoms are rated based on the severity of the residual symptoms a Veteran has after the injury. The VA considers 10 areas of impairment and evaluates the Veteran in each of these areas. The Veteran's overall TBI rating is based on the area with the highest level of impairment, unless it is more beneficial to assign separate ratings for distinct symptoms. However, a Veteran will not receive 10 individual ratings for each area; rather, a singular TBI rating is generally assigned\u00b9.\n\nIf the examiner diagnoses a TBI but notes no residual symptoms, a 0% rating is granted if service connection is warranted\u00b9.\n\nAdditionally, the VA must avoid pyramiding, meaning they cannot assign multiple ratings for the same symptoms. This is especially important because TBI symptoms often overlap with other conditions, such as PTSD. If the symptoms of TBI and PTSD cannot be separated, the ratings are lumped together. But if an examiner can clearly separate the symptoms of TBI and PTSD, the Veteran can receive two separate ratings for each disorder\u2075.\n\nThe severity of the TBI itself is determined by criteria such as loss of consciousness duration, brain imaging results, amnesia duration, and Glasgow Coma Scale scores, but this severity determination relates to the initial injury rather than the residual symptom rating\u00b3.\n\nIn summary:\n- The Veteran is evaluated in 10 impairment areas.\n- The highest impairment area determines the singular TBI rating.\n- Separate ratings may be possible if symptoms are distinct and separable.\n- No multiple ratings for the same symptoms (pyramiding prohibited).\n- Overlapping symptoms with PTSD may be combined unless separated by examiners\u00b9\u2075\u2076.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [How TBI is Rated](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/TBI)  \n\u00b3 [Severity of TBI](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/TBI)  \n\u2075 [PTSD & TBI](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)  \n\u2076 [Pyramiding](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals)",

Secondary conditions related to mental disorders, traumatic brain injury (TBI), spinal issues, and other service-connected disabilities may be eligible for service connection. However, the same symptom cannot be rated twice (pyramiding is prohibited).\n\nSome examples of common secondary conditions that may be service-connected include:\n\n- Erectile dysfunction, eye issues, heart conditions, high blood pressure, kidney issues, mental disorders, nerve issues, skin ulcers, stroke\u00b9\n- Secondary disabilities caused by mental disorders or medications used to treat them, such as sleep apnea, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), temporomandibular disorder (TMD)\u00b2\n- Secondary conditions related to TBI, such as headaches/migraines, hearing loss, hormone deficiencies, mental health conditions, Parkinson\u2019s disease, scars, seizures, tinnitus, vision impairment\u00b3\n- Nerve-based secondary conditions linked to spinal issues, which may receive favorable consideration and possibly earlier effective dates\u2074\n- Mental health conditions and migraines\u2075\n- Tinnitus\u2076\n- Hearing loss\u2077\n\nIt is important to have a proper diagnosis and medical evidence linking the secondary condition to the primary service-connected disability. Sometimes an Independent Medical Opinion (IMO) may be needed to establish this connection.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n\u00b9 [Common Secondary Conditions - (related_conditions)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/claimtype#secondary)  \n\u00b2 [Common Secondary Conditions - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/claimtype#secondary)  \n\u00b3 [Common Secondary Conditions - (related_conditions)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/claimtype#secondary)  \n\u2074 [Common Secondary Conditions - (references)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/claimtype#secondary)  \n\u2075 [Common Secondary Conditions - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/claimtype#secondary)  \n\u2076 [Common Secondary Condition - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/claimtype#secondary)  \n\u2077 [Common Secondary Condition - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/claimtype#secondary)",

Also, effective dates for such secondary conditions can be earlier if supported by medical evidence\u00b3\u2074\u2075.\n\nIn summary, your evidence should establish:\n- A current diagnosis of the secondary condition.\n- A service-connected primary condition.\n- A medical nexus linking the secondary condition to the primary service-connected condition.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [38 USC 1151 Claims (VA Negligence) - FAQ](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/1151#faq)  \n\u00b2 [Supplemental Claim (20-0995)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals#995)  \n\u00b3 [Supplemental Claim - (appeals)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/appeals#supplementalclaim)  \n\u2074 [Common Secondary Conditions - (references)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/claimtype#secondary)  \n\u2075 [Successful Claims - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vaclaim)",

However, it does mention that mental disorders and/or the medications used to treat them can cause secondary disabilities, which may be service-connected. GERD is listed as a common secondary condition, implying it could potentially be secondary to other conditions or their treatments, but there is no direct statement linking GERD specifically as secondary to PTSD medication in the sources provided.\n\nTherefore, while GERD is recognized as a possible secondary condition, there is no explicit confirmation in the provided information that GERD is secondary specifically to PTSD medication.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [DC 7206 - Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease - (rating_table)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/digsystem#7206)  \n\u00b2 [Common Secondary Conditions - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/claimtype#secondary)",

        "content": "Agent Orange presumptive refers to certain diseases and conditions that the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) presumes to be related to exposure to Agent Orange during military service. This means that if a veteran served in specific locations and time periods where Agent Orange exposure is recognized, and they develop one of these diseases, the VA will generally grant service connection for disability compensation without requiring the veteran to prove the direct link between the disease and the exposure.\n\nKey points about Agent Orange presumptive include:\n\n- Eligibility is based on where and when the veteran served, including locations such as the Republic of Vietnam, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Guam, American Samoa, Korean DMZ, Johnston Atoll, and certain Air Force units with C-123 aircraft exposure during specified date ranges\u00b9 \u2075.\n\n- The VA recognizes certain diseases as presumptive if they develop within one year of the last possible exposure to Agent Orange and reach at least 10% severity. These include:\n  - Chloracne or other acneform disease consistent with chloracne\n  - Early-onset peripheral neuropathy\n  - Porphyria cutanea tarda\u00b3\n\n- Veterans who served in locations where Agent Orange was stored, destroyed, or tested but are not presumptively exposed may still establish exposure if they provide evidence such as personnel records, evaluations, or medical records showing likely exposure\u2074.\n\n- Veterans exposed in Vietnam or its waters who were previously denied claims for conditions that later became presumptive may be eligible under the Nehmer class action provisions\u2076.\n\nIn summary, Agent Orange presumptive means the VA presumes certain diseases are related to Agent Orange exposure for veterans who served in specified locations and time frames, simplifying the process of obtaining disability benefits for those conditions.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Agent Orange Exposure - (presumptive)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/agentorange#agentorangeexposure)  \n\u00b3 [Presumptive Diseases - (presumptive)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/agentorange#presumptivediseases)  \n\u2074 [Eligibility (Part 2) - (eligibility)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/agentorange#eligibility)  \n\u2075 [Eligibility - (presumptive)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/agentorange#eligibility)  \n\u2076 [Nehmer Class Members (38 CFR 3.816) (Part 2) - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/agentorange#nehmerclassmembers38)",

This means that for certain conditions, the VA automatically assumes your military service caused the condition if you meet specific service criteria, so you do not have to prove the exposure caused your disability. Instead, you must show that you served in locations, time periods, or jobs associated with known toxic exposures, such as Agent Orange in Vietnam or burn pits in Iraq or Afghanistan\u00b9 \u00b3 \u2075.\n\nAdditionally, you can get a toxic exposure screening at VA health facilities, which can help identify if you were exposed to hazards like burn pits, Agent Orange, radiation, or contaminated water.

        "content": "The Chapter 33 Post-9/11 GI Bill is an education benefit program that provides up to 36 months of education benefits to veterans who have served on active duty after September 10, 2001. It can be used for various educational purposes including attending institutions of higher learning, training, licensing, and certification reimbursement. Veterans attending at least one class in a classroom may also be entitled to a housing allowance based on the military Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) for an E-5 with dependents at the location of the school where most classes are taken.\n\nEligibility requires an honorable period of active duty service on or after September 10, 2001. Veterans discharged before January 1, 2013, have 15 years to use this benefit, while those discharged after that date have no time limit to use it.\n\nBenefits include full tuition and mandatory fees paid directly to public institutions, capped tuition for private or foreign schools, a books and supplies stipend up to $1,000 per year (prorated if less than full-time), and potential eligibility for additional programs such as the Yellow Ribbon Program and a rural benefit payment. Veterans may also receive a monthly kicker payment if they qualified based on their military occupational specialty (MOS).\n\nThe benefit length is prorated based on the rate of pursuit (how many credits are taken), and taking more than a full load of credits does not use benefits faster.\n\nAdditionally, a Supreme Court decision in April 2024 allows veterans who served at least two qualifying periods\u2014one for the Montgomery GI Bill and another for the Post-9/11 GI Bill\u2014to potentially receive additional GI Bill benefits.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n\u00b9 [Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill) (Part 1)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter33post911gibi)  \n\u00b2 [Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill) (Part 2)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter33post911gibi)  \n\u00b3 [Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill) (Part 3)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter33post911gibi)  \n\u2074 [Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill) (Part 5)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter33post911gibi)  \n\u2075 [Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill) (Part 7)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter33post911gibi)  \n\u2076 [Chapter 30 (Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) - Active Duty) (Part 1)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter30montgomeryg)",

Under certain circumstances, remedial, deficiency, and refresher courses may also be approved.\n\nEligibility requires an honorable discharge, a high school diploma or GED (or sometimes 12 hours of college credit), and meeting specific service criteria. There are different eligibility categories based on service dates and conditions.\n\nAdditional features include a $600 Buy-Up Program, where servicemembers can contribute extra money while on active duty to increase their monthly benefits, and a \"kicker\" or Branch College Fund for those who served in critical shortage military occupational specialties, which increases the monthly benefit amount.\n\nThe MGIB benefits may be combined with the Post-9/11 GI Bill in some cases if the veteran served multiple qualifying periods of service.\n\nBenefits are generally payable for 10 years after release from active duty, and the program provides up to 36 months of education benefits\u00b3\u2074\u2076.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [GI Bill Education Benefits - FAQ](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibill#faq)  \n\u00b2 [Chapter 30 (Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) - Active Duty)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibill#chapter30montgomerygibillmgibactiveduty)  \n\u00b3 [Chapter 30 (Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) - Active Duty) (Part 3)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter30montgomeryg)  \n\u2074 [Chapter 30 (Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) - Active Duty) (Part 1)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter30montgomeryg)  \n\u2076 [Chapter 30 (Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) - Active Duty) (Part 2)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter30montgomeryg)",

        "content": "The Chapter 30 Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) is an education benefit program for veterans who served on active duty. It provides up to 36 months of education benefits, which can be used for college degree and certificate programs, technical or vocational courses, flight training, apprenticeships or on-the-job training, high-tech training, licensing and certification tests, entrepreneurship training, certain entrance examinations, and correspondence courses. Remedial, deficiency, and refresher courses may also be approved under certain circumstances. Benefits are generally payable for 10 years following honorable discharge from active service\u00b3.\n\nEligibility requires an honorable discharge, a high school diploma or GED (or in some cases 12 hours of college credit), and meeting one of several service categories, such as entering active duty after June 30, 1985, and not declining participation in the program, or other specific service conditions outlined in the categories\u00b9\u2074.\n\nAdditional features include a $600 Buy-Up Program where servicemembers may contribute up to $600 while on active duty to receive increased monthly benefits, and a \"kicker\" or Branch College Fund for veterans who joined a military occupational specialty with a critical shortage of personnel, which provides an additional monthly amount paid as a pro-rated lump sum at the start of the semester\u00b2\u2075.\n\nThere is also a recent Supreme Court decision (April 16, 2024) that allows veterans who served at least two qualifying periods\u2014one for the Montgomery GI Bill and another for the Post-9/11 GI Bill\u2014to potentially receive additional GI Bill benefits\u00b9\u00b3.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Chapter 30 (Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) - Active Duty) (Part 1) - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter30montgomeryg)  \n\u00b2 [Chapter 30 (Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) - Active Duty) (Part 3) - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter30montgomeryg)  \n\u00b3 [Chapter 30 (Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) - Active Duty) - (education)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibill#chapter30montgomerygibillmgibactiveduty)  \n\u2074 [Chapter 30 (Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) - Active Duty) (Part 2) - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter30montgomeryg)  \n\u2075 [Chapter 30 (Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) - Active Duty) (Part 3) - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter30montgomeryg)",

The MHA is based on the zip code of the campus where you physically attend the majority of your classes, not the location of the institution where you are enrolled. To receive MHA, you must be enrolled more than half time; those enrolled half time or less do not receive MHA. The allowance is prorated if you are less than full time. The MHA amount is equivalent to the military Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) for an E-5 with dependents at that location. MHA is prorated on a 30-day calendar basis for partial months of attendance\u00b9\u2074.\n\n- **Chapter 30 (Montgomery GI Bill):**  \n  There is no mention of a housing allowance or monthly housing stipend associated with the Montgomery GI Bill benefits in the provided context. The benefits mainly consist of a monthly stipend for education and training purposes\u00b3\u2075\u2077.\n\nIn summary, the housing allowance applies to the Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33) and is based on actual attendance location and enrollment status, while the Montgomery GI Bill (Chapter 30) does not provide a housing allowance.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n\u00b9 [Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill) (Part 1)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter33post911gibi)  \n\u00b3 [Chapter 30 (Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) - Active Duty) (Part 3)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter30montgomeryg)  \n\u2074 [Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill) (Part 6)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter33post911gibi)  \n\u2075 [Chapter 30 (Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) - Active Duty) (Part 1)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter30montgomeryg)  \n\u2077 [Chapter 30 (Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) - Active Duty) - (education)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibill#chapter30montgomerygibillmgibactiveduty)",

Once you have separated from the Armed Forces, you cannot designate new dependents to receive transferred benefits or amend the effective date of the initial transfer of entitlement. However, if a dependent who received transferred benefits dies, the Veteran/Servicemember may transfer any remaining unused benefits to a different eligible dependent. Similarly, if the Veteran/Servicemember dies after transferring benefits, the dependent may transfer unused benefits to another eligible dependent of the Veteran/Servicemember. Commissioned officers of the Public Health Service and NOAA are also eligible for this transferability option effective August 1, 2011. While in the Armed Forces, transferors use the Transfer of Education Benefits website to manage transfers; after leaving the Armed Forces, changes require a written request to VA\u00b9.\n\nThere is no information in the provided context about transferring Montgomery GI Bill (Chapter 30) benefits.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [GI Bill Education Benefits - FAQ](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibill#faq)",

        "content": "You cannot use VR&E (Veterans Readiness and Employment) and DEA (Dependents' Educational Assistance) at the same time\u00b9. However, regarding the use of GI Bill education benefits (such as Chapter 30 Montgomery GI Bill or Chapter 33 Post-9/11 GI Bill) with VR&E:\n\n- Veterans have a lifetime limit of 48 months of GI Bill benefits.\n- This limit does not prevent the Veteran from using other education benefits such as VR&E.\n- Using your GI Bill before VR&E generally goes against the limit usages for VR&E unless the GI Bill usage is considered as having been under VR&E via retroactive induction. In that case, the VA would restore the GI Bill eligibility (months used) and count those months against the VR&E entitlement instead\u00b3.\n- When using VR&E, you will need to apply for the Post 9/11 GI Bill to show eligibility or remaining entitlement to get the BAH rate, but you will not be using up any of your GI Bill entitlement by using VR&E\u00b2.\n\nSo, while you cannot use VR&E and DEA simultaneously, you can use GI Bill benefits and VR&E, but there are specific rules about how the months of entitlement are counted and coordinated.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Veterans Readiness and Employment (VR&E) Chapter 31 - FAQ](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vre#faq)  \n\u00b2 [Other Benefits of VRE (Part 3)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vre#otherbenefitsofvre)  \n\u00b3 [GI Bill Education Benefits](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibill#gibilleducationbenefits)",

        "content": "The \"Forever GI Bill\" refers to the Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33) education benefits, which provide up to 36 months of education benefits to veterans who served on active duty after September 10, 2001. Key features of the Forever GI Bill include:\n\n- There is **no time limit** to use the benefits if the veteran was discharged after January 1, 2013. Veterans discharged before that date have 15 years to use the benefit\u00b9\u2074.\n- Benefits cover full tuition and mandatory fees paid directly to public schools, with capped rates for private or foreign schools. Additional programs like the Yellow Ribbon Program may help cover extra costs at private institutions\u00b9\u2076.\n- Veterans attending at least one class in a classroom may receive a housing allowance equal to the military BAH for an E-5 with dependents at the school location\u00b9.\n- The Forever GI Bill can be combined with Montgomery GI Bill (Chapter 30) benefits if the veteran served at least two qualifying periods of service, potentially allowing for additional GI Bill benefits\u2075.\n\nThe Montgomery GI Bill (Chapter 30) provides up to 36 months of a monthly stipend for education and training, generally payable for 10 years following honorable discharge. It can be used for various educational programs and includes options like a $600 Buy-Up Program to increase benefits and a kicker for critical shortage MOS\u00b3\u2075.\n\nIn summary, the Forever GI Bill primarily refers to the Post-9/11 GI Bill with its expanded and extended benefits, including the removal of the time limit for use after 2013, and it can be combined with Montgomery GI Bill benefits under certain conditions\u2075.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill) (Part 1)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter33post911gibi)  \n\u00b2 [Chapter 30 (Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) - Active Duty) (Part 1)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter30montgomeryg)  \n\u00b3 [Chapter 30 (Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) - Active Duty) (Part 3)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter30montgomeryg)  \n\u2074 [Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill) (Part 2)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter33post911gibi)  \n\u2075 [Chapter 30 (Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) - Active Duty) - (education)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibill#chapter30montgomerygibillmgibactiveduty)  \n\u2076 [Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill) (Part 3)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter33post911gibi)",

        "content": "A 1151 claim is a type of VA disability claim that provides compensation for disabilities caused, worsened, or death resulting from the carelessness, negligence, lack of proper skill, error in judgment, or similar fault by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) during hospital care, medical or surgical treatment, examination, or participation in a compensated work therapy program. This includes aggravation of pre-existing conditions, new disabilities, and deaths caused by VA care or compensated work therapy programs\u00b9\u2074\u2076.\n\nTo win a 1151 claim, the Veteran must show three elements:\n\n1. An event involving VA fault (such as negligence or error in judgment).\n2. Disability or death that began or worsened after this event.\n3. A nexus letter or independent medical opinion linking the event to the disability or death.\n\nThere is no special form for filing a 1151 claim; the Veteran simply needs to identify the claim as a 1151 claim when filing with the VA. It is important to specify where and approximately when the event occurred and explain how the VA provider erred.\n\nAdditionally, 1151 claims can be filed for care received outside a VA Medical Center if the care was referred by the VA, the Veteran would not have suffered the disability/death but for the VA referral, and the VA's negligence caused the harm\u2077.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Winning a 1151 Claim - (claims_special)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/1151#winninga1151claim)  \n\u00b2 [Winning a 1151 Claim - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/1151#winninga1151claim)  \n\u2074 [38 USC 1151 Claims (VA Negligence) - FAQ - (faq)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/1151#faq)  \n\u2076 [38 USC 1151 Claims (VA Negligence) - (claims_special)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/1151#38usc1151claimsvanegligence)  \n\u2077 [38 USC 1151 Claims (VA Negligence) - FAQ - (faq)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/1151#faq)",

Provide a Nexus letter or independent medical opinion linking the event to the disability or death.\n- Explain how the VA provider was negligent, careless, or made an error that caused the harm.\n\nThis information helps the VA obtain relevant records and properly evaluate your claim.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Winning a 1151 Claim - (claims_special)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/1151#winninga1151claim)  \n\u00b2 [Winning a 1151 Claim - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/1151#winninga1151claim)",

Compensation can be paid for disabilities or death caused by VA carelessness, negligence, or error in judgment related to medical treatment or examinations. Specifically, compensation is available if:\n\n- The disability or death resulted from VA acts of omission, such as failure to obtain informed consent prior to treatment or failure to provide timely diagnosis or treatment.\n\n- There was an error in judgment involving negligence (not just a misdiagnosis or treatment that was later found incorrect).\n\n- The disability or death was caused by VA examinations or compensated work therapy program participation under specific conditions.\n\n- The VA carelessness or negligence directly resulted in the disability or death.\n\nAdditionally, if the VA referred you to a non-VA facility and the disability or death would not have occurred but for that referral and VA negligence, you may also be eligible for compensation.\n\nExaminations for 1151 claims are conducted by third-party contractors to avoid conflicts of interest, and you can also provide your own medical opinion at your own cost.\n\nYou can also claim conditions that developed or were aggravated by a condition granted under 1151.\n\nIn summary, compensation for VA medical error is possible if the error was due to negligence or carelessness by the VA and caused or aggravated a disability or death\u00b3\u2074\u2076\u2077.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n\u00b9 [38 USC 1151 Claims (VA Negligence) - FAQ](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/1151#faq)  \n\u00b2 [38 USC 1151 Claims (VA Negligence) - FAQ](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/1151#faq)  \n\u00b3 [38 USC 1151 Claims (VA Negligence) - FAQ](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/1151#faq)  \n\u2074 [Detailed Explanation of Criteria](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/1151#detailedexplanationofcriteria)  \n\u2076 [38 USC 1151 Claims (VA Negligence) - FAQ](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/1151#faq)  \n\u2077 [Detailed Explanation of Criteria (Part 1)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/1151#detailedexplanationo)",

Our internal confidence score is **48.6%** for this response - please verify the answer with your own due diligence. A report has been generated and someone will review this.\n\nThe Nehmer rule refers to a VA policy under 38 CFR 3.816 that requires the VA to grant earlier effective dates for certain presumptive conditions related to Agent Orange exposure when those conditions were diagnosed before they became presumptive and the initial claim was filed before the condition was added to the presumptive list. Specifically:\n\n- It applies to conditions named in 38 CFR 3.309(e) except chloracne.\n- When a new presumptive condition is added, the VA must review prior decisions and grant earlier effective dates as appropriate.\n- The rule allows veterans to receive service connection effective from the date of the initial claim if there was evidence of diagnosis before the condition became presumptive.\n- Claims filed after the condition became presumptive are not subject to Nehmer but may still be eligible under liberalizing law.\n- Some conditions like hypertension and MGUS are currently not eligible for Nehmer consideration.\n\nFor example, if a veteran filed a claim for lung cancer before it became presumptive and had medical evidence of diagnosis, the VA must grant service connection effective from the date of the initial claim, even if the claim was denied initially and later reopened after the condition became presumptive.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Nehmer Class Members (38 CFR 3.816) (Part 4) - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/agentorange#nehmerclassmembers38)  \n\u00b2 [Nehmer Class Members (38 CFR 3.816) (Part 3) - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/agentorange#nehmerclassmembers38)",

These criteria include:\n\n- The Veteran is permanently and totally disabled from service-connected conditions;\n- The Veteran died in service;\n- The Veteran died of service-connected causes; or\n- The Veteran is currently missing in action or captured in the line of duty\u00b9.\n\nThe program offers up to 36 months of education or training benefits for those using the benefit on or after August 1, 2018. It can be used for undergraduate or graduate degrees, certificate or diploma courses from business, technical or vocational schools, apprenticeships, and on-the-job training programs. Spouses may also use the benefit for correspondence courses. The benefit is paid directly to the dependent, and each dependent has their own individual entitlement\u00b2.\n\nAdditional important notes include that children cannot receive both Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) and DEA at the same time, and DEA benefits do not count against the maximum 48 months of educational benefits if the dependent is eligible for other education benefits\u00b2.\n\nEligibility requirements vary depending on when the event that made the dependent eligible occurred, with different rules applying for events before or on/after August 1, 2023\u00b3\u2074.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Chapter 35 (Dependents' Educational Assistance - DEA)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/pnt)  \n\u00b2 [Benefit - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)  \n\u00b3 [Eligibility Requirements for Dependent Children and Spouses - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/ears)  \n\u2074 [Eligibility Requirements for Dependent Children (Historical) - (notes)](https://veteransbenefitskb.com)",

The screening is provided to every Veteran enrolled in VA health care initially and then at least once every 5 years. Veterans not enrolled but who meet eligibility requirements can also enroll to receive the screening. After the screening, Veterans receive information about benefits, registry exams, and clinical resources they may need. Veterans can request the screening at their VA health care appointment, contact their local VA facility, or schedule a telehealth screening via the VET-HOME website\u00b9.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Toxic exposure screenings - (presumptive)](https://www.va.gov/resources/the-pact-act-and-your-va-benefits/#toxicexposurescreenings)",

The program involves an agreement between the VA and participating schools to share the cost of tuition and fees that are not covered by the GI Bill. The specific amount and availability depend on the school and factors such as degree type and program. To participate, veterans must apply for Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits, submit their certificate of eligibility to their school, and request to apply for the Yellow Ribbon Program. The school then determines the number of students accepted and the amount of funding available, notifying the student of approval and the amount awarded\u00b3\u2074\u2076.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Reference - (education)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/yellow#reference)  \n\u00b2 [Yellow Ribbon Program - FAQ - (faq)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/yellow#faq)  \n\u00b3 [Yellow Ribbon Program - FAQ - (faq)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/yellow#faq)  \n\u2074 [Yellow Ribbon Program - FAQ - (faq)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/yellow#faq)  \n\u2076 [Application Process - (education)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/yellow#applicationprocess)",

Here is how it works with the Post-9/11 GI Bill:\n\n- The Post-9/11 GI Bill provides up to 36 months of education benefits, including full tuition and mandatory fees paid directly to public institutions.\n- For private or foreign schools, tuition and fees are capped at a national maximum rate.\n- Veterans attending private higher learning institutions may be eligible for the Yellow Ribbon Program, which helps cover additional education-related costs not covered by the VA.\n- To use the Yellow Ribbon Program, you must apply for it through your school\u2019s certifying official or financial aid office when submitting your certificate of eligibility (COE).\n- The school will determine if it has reached the maximum number of students accepted into the Yellow Ribbon Program and the amount of money you will receive.\n- You will be notified by your school if you are approved for the Yellow Ribbon Program and the amount awarded.\n\nThe Montgomery GI Bill (Chapter 30) does not mention eligibility or use of the Yellow Ribbon Program in the provided context.\n\nTherefore, Yellow Ribbon is a benefit enhancement available only for those using the Post-9/11 GI Bill and attending private or foreign schools to help cover tuition and fees beyond the VA cap.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Application Process - (education)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/yellow#applicationprocess)  \n\u00b2 [Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill) (Part 3) - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibills#chapter33post911gibi)",

Additionally, there are enhanced pension benefits such as Aid and Attendance for veterans who need help with daily activities or are bedridden due to illness, or Housebound benefits for those who are substantially confined to their home due to disability\u2074\u2076.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Eligibility - (pension)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/pension-housebound#eligibility)  \n\u2074 [Eligibility - (pension)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/pension-aa#eligibility)  \n\u2076 [Aid and Attendance (Pension) - (pension)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/pension-aa#aidandattendancepension)",

        "content": "The VA's duty to assist is a legal obligation to help Veterans obtain the benefits and recognition they deserve by assisting in two main areas:\n\n- Obtaining records relevant to the claim.\n- Providing a medical examination or obtaining medical opinions when necessary.\n\nA foundational part of this duty is the VA's duty to notify, which involves sending a \"5103 notice\" that explains what evidence is needed to properly support a claim or appeal. Failure to send this notice is a common duty to assist error.\n\nAdditionally, the VA should assist claimants even if the claim is vague or incomplete by clarifying what benefits are being claimed or informing the claimant if the application is incomplete.\n\nFor the VA to have a duty to provide a medical examination or obtain medical opinions, three elements must all be met:\n\n1. A statement of symptoms or current diagnosis.\n2. Evidence of an in-service event or a service-connected disability that caused or worsened the condition.\n3. A reasonable possibility that the condition and the in-service event or service-connected disability are related (nexus).\n\nIf these criteria are not met, the VA has no duty to provide an examination or medical opinion.\n\nAlso, there is no duty to assist with a new exam or opinion for supplemental claims if the Veteran does not submit new and relevant evidence with their appeal. Furthermore, if the rater can grant the maximum schedular evaluation based on existing evidence, an examination is not needed.\n\nIn summary, the VA's duty to assist includes helping Veterans by obtaining necessary records, providing medical examinations or opinions when appropriate, and notifying Veterans of what evidence is required to support their claims\u00b3\u2076.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Duty to Assist (DTA) - (claims_process)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/dta#dutytoassistdta)  \n\u00b2 [Standard Procedures - (claims_process)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/dta#standardprocedures)  \n\u00b3 [Duty to Assist (DTA) - Legal References - (references)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/dta#references)  \n\u2076 [Providing a Medical Examination/Obtaining Medical Opinions - (claims_process)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/dta#providingamedicalexaminationobtainingmedicalopinions)",

If the VA fails to notify you properly or does not make reasonable efforts, you may have grounds to complain or seek assistance.

        "content": "Whether you can get benefits with an Other than Honorable discharge depends on the specific benefit and circumstances:\n\n- For GI Bill education benefits, if you earned the GI Bill from a period of honorable service, you can keep the benefit even if you later receive an Other than Honorable discharge\u00b9. Also, if you reenlisted or had a prior honorable period of service, you may still qualify for the GI Bill, though benefits may be prorated if the honorable service period was shorter than needed for full entitlement\u00b2.\n\n- For VA disability benefits, generally your character of discharge must be Honorable (including General, Under Honorable) to be eligible. However, even if your discharge was not Honorable, you may still be eligible in some cases, especially if you have a chronic disability related to service\u2074. Also, the Veteran's last character of discharge must have been Honorable for eligibility through their own or a relative's service\u2077.\n\n- If you have an Other than Honorable discharge and a mental health diagnosis, you should apply to have your discharge upgraded, which may improve eligibility for benefits\u00b3.\n\nIn summary, an Other than Honorable discharge does not automatically disqualify you from all benefits, but eligibility varies by benefit type and circumstances. Applying for a discharge upgrade may be advisable if you have a mental health condition.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [GI Bill Education Benefits - FAQ](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibill#faq)  \n\u00b2 [GI Bill Education Benefits - FAQ](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/gibill#faq)  \n\u00b3 [Discharge Upgrade](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/mental)  \n\u2074 [Eligibility - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/upgrade)  \n\u2077 [Eligibility - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com)",

This coverage also includes traveling directly to or from their place of duty. To properly file a disability claim, they should have their unit issue a Line of Duty (LOD) determination or a Notice of Eligibility (NOE) if in the U.S. Coast Guard Reserve. Without an LOD/NOE, they will need to rely on buddy letters or personal statements as evidence. Pre- and post-deployment physicals can also serve as evidence if accurate and complete\u00b9.\n\nAdditionally, eligibility for VA disability benefits generally requires having a chronic disability related to military service, an honorable or general under honorable discharge, and service on Active Duty, ADT, or IADT, which includes National Guard service\u00b2.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [National Guard/Reserves - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vaclaim#top)  \n\u00b2 [Eligibility - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/upgrade)",

        "content": "Pre-existing condition aggravation refers to the worsening of a condition that existed before military service due to service or a service-connected condition. There are two main types:\n\n1. **Aggravation of a Preexisting (Pre-service) Condition:** This occurs when military service worsens a condition that existed before service. The VA presumes a veteran was \"sound\" (without condition) at entry unless the condition was noted during the Military Entrance Processing Station (MEPS) exam or is a chronic condition diagnosed shortly after service that likely existed before service. Medical evidence is required to prove the condition existed prior to service. Statements alone from the veteran or others do not carry weight without medical evidence. If the Department of Defense lost entrance physical records, the VA assumes no preexisting condition unless exceptions apply.\n\n2. **Aggravation of an Existing (Post-service) Condition:** This is when a service-connected condition worsens a condition that developed after service. To establish aggravation, the VA must determine the severity of the condition before and after aggravation and obtain a medical opinion that the service-connected condition worsened the existing condition beyond its natural progression\u00b9.\n\nIn rating aggravated conditions, the VA subtracts the preexisting condition's severity from the current severity to determine the aggravated rating. For preexisting (pre-service) conditions, if the preexisting condition rates 100%, the final rating remains 100%. If the VA cannot determine the preexisting severity, it assumes 0% severity\u00b9\u00b3.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [Aggravation of a Preexisting (Pre-service) Condition](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/agg#aggravationofapreexistingpreservicecondition)  \n\u00b2 [Aggravation of an Existing (Post-service) Condition](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/agg#aggravationofanexistingpostservicecondition)  \n\u00b3 [Rating Aggravated Conditions](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/agg#ratingaggravatedconditions)",

Our internal confidence score is **49.9%** for this response - please verify the answer with your own due diligence. A report has been generated and someone will review this.\n\nYou should not file a claim without having the bare minimum evidence. Before filing a claim, you need to have all three of the following parts:\n\n- Statement of symptoms (how the condition affects you) or current diagnosis.\n- An in-service event (documented or supported by lay statements) showing the condition started in service, or a service-connected disability that caused or worsened your disability.\n- A nexus, meaning a layperson would think that the symptoms or diagnosis and the in-service event are related.\n\nIf your claim does not have all three parts, you should not file it because it will be denied without even being sent to a Compensation & Pension Exam (C&P)\u00b9.\n\nRegarding medical records specifically, you can provide private medical records or non-VA hospital reports as evidence, but if you want the VA to obtain them for you, you must provide a VA Form 21-4142/21-4142a. The VA can also access your VHA medical records themselves, so it is not necessary to upload them as part of your claim\u00b2.\n\nIn summary, while you might not need to submit all medical records yourself, you must have sufficient evidence including symptoms or diagnosis, in-service event, and nexus before filing a claim.

Without all three, your claim will likely be denied without even being sent for a Compensation & Pension Exam (C&P)\u00b9.\n\nAdditionally, if your condition is congenital or genetic (something you were born with), it generally cannot be rated unless it manifested during service after the expected development period or was aggravated by service\u00b2.\n\nAlso, private medical records outside your military treatment records are not automatically included in your service record. You must coordinate with your base medical to have those records added if you want them considered in your claim\u00b3.\n\nIn summary, you can get benefits for conditions not in your service record if you can establish a service connection with sufficient evidence and meet the VA's claim requirements.\n\n**Sources:**\n\u00b9 [BARE MINIMUM You Need BEFORE You File a Claim](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/vaclaim)  \n\u00b2 [Congenital or Genetic Conditions - (policy)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/norate)  \n\u00b3 [Active Duty Servicemembers - (notes)](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/cnp)",
